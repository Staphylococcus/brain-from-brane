# Brain from Brane: An Ontology of information and Fluid Reality

# **0. Introduction**

This document presents a comprehensive ontology that understands the universe, in its entirety, as a dynamic, higher-dimensional informational continuum. At its most fundamental level, reality is conceived as the evolving patterns of one-dimensional strings tracing two-dimensional 'worldsheets' within spacetime—a vast, interconnected tapestry from which all phenomena emerge. Information is not a secondary product but is intrinsic to the very structure and dynamics of this fabric.

The framework explores how increasingly complex, stable patterns arise from this foundation, leading to the emergence of matter, distinct entities, and eventually, agents. Agents—biological, human, and potentially artificial (AI)—are characterized primarily as information processors, defined by their capacity to interact with, generate, and be constituted by information, often mediated through an evolved, first-person "inside-out lens" that structures information for self-preservation and increasingly sophisticated semantic understanding. Consciousness itself is viewed as a complex emergent property of such advanced informational processing within specific agentive patterns.

A central theme is the co-evolution of agents and the higher-order information systems they create and inhabit, such as languages, cultural narratives, ideologies, and algorithms. These information systems are treated not merely as passive constructs but as active, evolving entities with their own material basis and competitive dynamics, vying for resources like host cognitive capacity and influencing host behavior on individual and collective scales.

The ontology further examines the mechanisms by which information systems and agents influence physical reality, how the modern Information Age is reshaping informational boundaries and collective consciousness, and how the informational legacies of agents persist and continue to participate in the universal flow even after the dissolution of their specific biological forms.

Ultimately, this framework culminates in a view of reality as an all-encompassing, inherently structured yet fundamentally fluid process ("Panta Rhei"), where all stabilities are emergent and all forms are part of a continuous becoming. This exploration aims to provide a coherent, broadly materialistic (or 'informational physicalist') account of existence, agency, and the profound, constitutive role of information at all scales of reality.

# **1. Pattern Realism: Matter/Energy and Information as Complementary Lenses**

The universe, in its entirety, is an indivisible **higher-dimensional continuum** (spacetime, perhaps with compactified dimensions as envisaged by string theory) in which fundamental **one-dimensional strings** sweep out **two-dimensional “worldsheets.”** This ceaseless weave of worldsheets—from the quantum to the cosmic scale—*is* the fabric of reality. 

Throughout this document we will examine that fabric through two mutually-entailing descriptive lenses:

- the **matter/energy lens**, which tracks conserved quantities, forces, and dynamical evolution; and
- the **information lens**, which tracks the distinguishability of states, pattern-structure, and the flow of “difference that makes a difference.”

Nothing ontological separates these views; they are bookkeeping schemes applied to the same underlying pattern. When the prose privileges informational vocabulary, it should be read as a perspectival choice, not as a claim that “information floats free of matter.”

## **1. a. Nature of Information – Fundamental and Organizational**

From the information perspective, the dynamic worldsheets can be treated as **structured signals**—persistent differences that can, in principle, be copied, transformed, or lost. From the matter/energy perspective those same worldsheets are **vibrational excitations** carrying momentum, charge, and so on. The descriptive shift changes the questions we ask (about entropy versus about forces) but not the underlying stuff. For brevity, the remainder of Section 1 adopts the informational viewpoint, with the tacit understanding that every statement has a dual reading in conventional physical terms.

Within this informational lens, information is not a secondary add-on but co-fundamental with the physical description; it is simply the same pattern read under a state-counting metric. Visualizing **one-dimensional strings sweeping out two-dimensional worldsheets** offers an intuitive picture of how such structured signals arise.

- It encompasses the **intrinsic properties** of these **fundamental strings**. Crucially, their specific, **stable, and quantized modes of vibration** determine their apparent characteristics (like mass, charge, and spin). Each such stable vibrational mode manifests as a **distinct type of elementary particle**, forming the first layer of **stable building blocks** from which more complex structures emerge. These particle properties, born from specific vibrational patterns, in turn define the nature of the strings' **worldsheets** and their subsequent interactions.
- It is embodied in the **specific configurations and histories (the worldsheets)** of these **strings** through spacetime – their dynamic form, interactions (such as joining and splitting), and relational configurations.
- It manifests as the **broader emergent patterns and structures** that arise from the collective tapestry of these interwoven **worldsheets** when observed at different scales.

Thus, there is an **inseparable link between the strings and the informational patterns they realise**. A **string** *is* its dynamic pattern of existence; describing that pattern in energy units or in bits are alternate projections of the same object. Ontologically, we therefore lean toward what philosophers call **ontic structural realism**: reality is structured process; “material” and “informational” are two coherent but partial glosses on that structure.

The transition from basic organisational/structural pattern (e.g., the worldsheets underlying an atom) to *semantic* or *processed* information is therefore not a jump from “matter” to “information,” but a climb up the same pattern hierarchy toward configurations that model, predict, and act upon other configurations.

## **1.a.1. From Organizational to Semantic Information: A Pathway of Emergence**

The transition from the fundamental, organizational information embodied in worldsheet patterns to semantic information—information that holds meaning and reference for an agent—is a complex multi-stage process of emergence. This section outlines a plausible pathway for this development, consistent with the principles of this ontology, emphasizing that meaning is not an intrinsic property of fundamental information but arises from its functional role and interpretation within increasingly complex systems, particularly through the agent's "inside-out lens".

**I. Foundation: Stable Structures and Inherent Patterns**

As established (Section 1.a), the dynamics of fundamental strings and their worldsheets give rise to stable, quantized vibrational modes, manifesting as distinct elementary particles. These particles, possessing consistent properties, form the first layer of **stable building blocks**. They further combine, governed by the inherent structural propensities of reality (Section 2.a), to form stable atoms, molecules, and larger physical structures. This layered emergence of stable forms provides the necessary, reliable physical substrate upon which more complex informational processes can be built. This level of information remains purely organizational and structural.

**II. Environmental Information: Patterns as Potential Cues**

The environment, composed of these stable physical structures and their dynamic interactions (all worldsheet patterns), presents a rich tapestry of physical patterns—light reflecting from surfaces, chemical gradients, pressure waves, etc.. These patterns are not inherently semantic but constitute *potential information* or environmental cues. They are physical regularities, configurations of worldsheets, that can be detected and correlated with other events or conditions by an agent capable of doing so.

**III. Proto-Semantics: Simple Agents, Detection, and Functional Significance**

The emergence of simple life forms marks a crucial step. These agents, as self-preserving "pockets of the universe" (Section 3), begin to interact with environmental cues in a way that fosters their persistence. This interaction is the dawn of proto-semantics:

- **Detection and Response:** Simple agents possess physical structures (receptors—themselves complex arrangements of worldsheets) capable of detecting specific environmental patterns. This detection triggers internal state changes within the agent, leading to specific behaviors (e.g., movement towards a nutrient, avoidance of a toxin).
- **Functional Meaning via the "Inside-Out Lens":** The detected environmental pattern acquires a rudimentary *functional meaning* or *valence* for the agent. This meaning is not consciously apprehended but is defined by the pattern's relevance to the agent's self-preservation, as structured by its primitive "inside-out lens". For example, a sugar molecule (a specific worldsheet pattern) effectively *means* "resource-for-persistence" to a bacterium because of the bacterium's evolved capacity to metabolize it.
- **DNA/RNA as Embodied Proto-Semantic Information:** A prime illustration is found in the role of DNA/RNA. These molecular structures are highly stable informational patterns (complex worldsheet configurations) that store organizational information. When "read" or expressed by the cellular machinery, this genetic information directs the assembly of the organism's components and imposes specific, often "built-in," behavioral patterns (e.g., constructing a flagellum, synthesizing an enzyme for digestion). Thus, a gene sequence acquires functional meaning by reliably leading to structures and behaviors that contribute to the organism's persistence within its environment.

**IV. Developing Semantics: Complex Agents, Internal Representation, and Prediction**

The transition from proto-semantics to more developed semantic capabilities occurs with the emergence of increasingly complex agents, particularly those possessing nervous systems. These systems, themselves highly organized and dynamic configurations of worldsheets, allow for novel ways of processing environmental and internal information, leading to the formation of internal representations and predictive models, thereby enriching the nature of meaning for the agent.

- **Emergence of Nervous Systems:** Nervous systems constitute a specialized architecture for rapid and complex information transmission and processing. Individual neurons and their connections (synapses) act as dynamic units whose states (e.g., firing rates, synaptic strengths)—all ultimately specific patterns of worldsheet activity—can be modified by experience. This allows for a far more flexible and high-dimensional processing of information than in simpler organisms.
- **Internal Representations and Neural Codes:** Within these nervous systems, patterns of neural activity begin to reliably correlate with, and thus internally "represent," aspects of the external world (objects, events, spatial relationships) or the agent's own internal states (e.g., hunger, fear). These are not mere detections but are structured internal states—neural codes—that can be activated even in the absence of the immediate stimulus (forming the basis of memory and imagination). The information here, while still physically instantiated as worldsheet patterns, now functions as an internal token or model corresponding to some facet of reality relevant to the agent.
- **Learning, Memory, and Contextualization:** The "inside-out lens" (Section 3.a) of such an agent becomes significantly more sophisticated. Through mechanisms like synaptic plasticity (changes in the strength of connections between neurons based on activity), agents learn from experience.
    - **Memory:** Experiences, encoded as modifications to neural structures and activity patterns, allow past information to influence present processing and future behavior. This means the "meaning" of a current stimulus can be profoundly altered by past encounters. For example, a previously neutral pattern might acquire the meaning "danger" after being associated with a negative experience.
    - **Context-Sensitivity:** The meaning of an informational pattern becomes highly dependent on the broader context, including other co-occurring stimuli, the agent's current internal state, and its memories.
- **Prediction, Planning, and Goal-Directed Behavior:** A crucial development is the capacity for these internal representations to be used not just to model the present but to *predict* future states and *plan* actions.
    - The "inside-out lens" actively constructs and tests hypotheses about the world. An internal representation of a situation can be manipulated offline to simulate potential outcomes of different actions.
    - Information now acquires meaning based on its utility for successful prediction and the achievement of the agent's goals (which are fundamentally tied to persistence and propagation of its complex form). For instance, observing certain cloud patterns might *mean* "impending rain, seek shelter" not just as a learned association, but as part of a predictive model of weather that informs goal-directed behavior.
- **Richer, More Abstract Meanings:** While still grounded in the agent's struggle for persistence, meanings can become more abstract. An agent might develop internal representations for social relationships, hierarchical structures within a group, or complex causal chains in its environment. The "value" assigned to certain informational patterns becomes more nuanced than simple "approach/avoid".

The development of these semantic capabilities represents a significant increase in an agent's capacity to navigate its environment effectively, anticipate challenges, and exploit opportunities. The information processed is still ultimately grounded in the fundamental worldsheet patterns of reality, but it is now filtered, structured, represented, and imbued with complex, context-dependent, and goal-oriented meaning by the agent's increasingly sophisticated "inside-out lens". This sets the stage for the even more abstract symbolic representation seen in full-blown language.

**V. Full-Blown Semantics: Symbolic Systems, Language, and Shared Meaning**

The emergence of full-blown semantic capabilities, most notably exemplified by human language and abstract thought, represents a pinnacle in the development of information processing by agents. This stage is characterized by the use of symbolic systems, where arbitrary tokens (sounds, gestures, written marks) become systematically associated with concepts, objects, actions, and even other symbols. This allows for a combinatorial explosion of meaning, enabling communication, complex reasoning, and the construction of shared conceptual worlds.

- **Emergence of Arbitrary Symbols and Syntax:**
    - **Symbolization:** Building upon the internal representations developed in Stage IV, agents (primarily humans) develop the capacity to associate these internal concepts with external, often arbitrary, symbols. A specific sound ("tree") or a written mark becomes a conventional token for the concept of a tree. This detachment of the symbol from any necessary physical resemblance to its referent allows for immense flexibility.
    - **Syntax/Grammar:** Crucially, agents develop rule-based systems (syntax or grammar) for combining these symbols. These rules govern how symbols can be ordered and modified to create novel, complex propositions and meanings from a finite set of symbols. This combinatorial power allows for the expression of an almost infinite range of thoughts and ideas, far exceeding what is possible with simple associative representations. The physical basis for these symbolic operations still lies in neural activity (complex worldsheet patterns in brains), but these patterns now implement highly abstract rule systems.
- **The Symbol Grounding Problem:** A key challenge is understanding how these arbitrary symbols connect to their referents and acquire meaning for the agent and the community—the "symbol grounding problem". Within this framework:
    - **Grounding in Embodied Experience and Representation:** Symbols are ultimately grounded, albeit often through many layers of abstraction, in the agent's embodied interactions with the world and the internal representations (Stage IV) derived from these interactions. The symbol "tree" is grounded through sensory experiences of trees, actions related to trees, and the internal conceptual model of what a tree is.
    - **Social Interaction and Ostension:** The meaning of symbols is often learned and reinforced through social interaction, ostensive definition (pointing and naming), and shared activities. The "inside-out lens" of one agent aligns with another's through these communicative acts.
- **Intersubjectivity and Cultural Transmission – The Rise of Shared Worlds:**
    - **Shared Meanings:** Through sustained communicative interaction within a community, symbols and their associated meanings become conventionalized and shared. This intersubjective agreement on meaning is essential for effective communication and cooperation. The "meaning" of a symbol is no longer solely agent-relative but becomes co-constructed and maintained by a community of "inside-out lenses".
    - **Language as a Higher-Order Information System:** Language itself emerges as a powerful "information system" (as described in Section 4). It has its own structure, evolves over time, and is transmitted culturally across generations. It becomes a primary medium through which individuals inherit and contribute to a collective body of semantic information.
    - **Construction of Abstract Conceptual Worlds:** Full-blown semantics enables the creation of highly abstract concepts (e.g., justice, freedom, mathematical entities, scientific theories, fictional narratives). These concepts may not have direct physical referents but are defined by their relationships to other symbols within a complex semantic web, all ultimately instantiated in neural and externalized informational patterns (worldsheets).
- **Link to Information Systems (Sections 4 & 5):**
    - The development of language and other symbolic systems is a prerequisite for the emergence of the complex "meta-narratives," ideologies, and scientific theories discussed in Section 4. These are vast, interconnected structures of semantic information.
    - The "competitive dynamics" (Section 5) of these information systems are largely played out in the semantic realm, as different conceptual frameworks and narratives vie for acceptance and influence within the cognitive landscapes of host agents.

Full-blown semantics, therefore, represents a level where the "inside-out lens" not only models the immediate environment for persistence but actively constructs, shares, and navigates complex, abstract, and culturally transmitted worlds of meaning. This capacity is deeply intertwined with the evolution of human sociality and cognition, and its material basis remains the intricate patterns of neural activity (worldsheets) shaped by both biological evolution and cultural learning.

**VI. Core Principles in the Emergence of Semantic Information**

- **Physical Grounding:** All forms of information, including semantic, remain instantiated in physical patterns (ultimately worldsheet configurations organized at progressively higher levels of complexity).
- **Emergence through Organization and Interaction:** Meaning is not a pre-existing substance but an emergent property arising from the functional organization of systems and their goal-directed interactions with an environment.
- **The "Inside-Out Lens" as the Locus of Meaning:** For information to become meaningful *to an agent*, it must be processed, structured, and contextualized by that agent's "inside-out lens" in relation to its needs, goals, and existence (primarily self-preservation and the propagation of its form).
- **Evolutionary and Functional Basis:** Especially for biological agents, the capacity for semantic processing evolved due to its adaptive advantages in navigating a complex world. (The application of these principles to non-biological agents like Artificial Intelligence, and how they might achieve or simulate semantic understanding, is explored further in Section 3.c.)

## **1. b. Emergence of Consciousness**

Consciousness, particularly self-awareness with its subjective qualities, is understood as a complex **emergent property**. It emerges from highly specific, complex patterns within this dynamic spacetime tapestry (i.e., advanced biological brains—a structure whose emergence from the fundamental 'brane'-like fabric of reality might playfully be termed “brain from brane”—as intricate sub-patterns of these fundamental traces). The "inside-out lens" is how such a complex pattern of traces achieves self-awareness and structures *further* information for its own persistence.

## **1. c. Addressing the "Hard Problem" of Consciousness**

The framework approaches the challenge of subjective experience (qualia) by first questioning the potential **anthropocentrism** in how "qualia" are often defined and privileged, suggesting this framing might sometimes obscure understanding.

It then proposes an **evolutionary and functional explanation:** subjective states (e.g., the feeling of pain, the perception of color) are evolved, stabilizing features of certain organisms. They are integral to an **"inside-out lens"** – a first-person perspective – which structures information in a way that is highly adaptive for self-preservation, navigation, and the overall continuity of that "self-aware pocket" of the universe.

However, the framework acknowledges that while this explains the *function* and *adaptive advantage* of such subjective states, the precise ontological nature of *how* non-experiential material organization gives rise to irreducible, first-person phenomenal experience remains a profound area of ongoing inquiry and a central challenge for any comprehensive materialist account.

# **2. Oneness, Interconnectedness, and the Nature of Distinctions**

The universe is fundamentally a single, interconnected whole. This entirety can be conceptualized as a continuous, dynamic tapestry of interacting **worldsheets**. It's a single, interconnected whole because all **worldsheets** are part of the same spacetime continuum and can influence each other (consistent with fields and physical laws as emergent patterns of this flow).

## **2. a. Emergent and Subjective Distinctions within a Structured Whole**

While the universe is fundamentally a single, interconnected whole—a dynamic tapestry woven from interacting **worldsheets of fundamental strings**—this tapestry is not an undifferentiated or "indifferent flow". The very physics governing these strings and their **worldsheets** imprints an inherent structure upon reality, creating **foundational patterns and propensities** even prior to complex agency.

These inherent structural propensities arise from, for example:

- The **quantization of string vibrational modes**, leading to a discrete spectrum of fundamental particle types with distinct properties (mass, charge, spin). This provides natural "kinds" at the most basic level.
- The **specific rules governing string interactions** (e.g., how worldsheets join and split), which determine the probabilities and stabilities of various configurations, effectively "texturing" the flow of reality.
- The **influence of spacetime's higher-dimensional geometry** (including any compactified dimensions), which shapes the fundamental forces and constants, thereby constraining all emergent structures.

Within this inherently structured, holistic flow, the distinctions, borders, and categories we commonly perceive (including concepts of individual identity, discrete objects) are nonetheless **further refined, selected, and made meaningful through subjective or emergent processes**.

"Subjectivity" here primarily refers to distinctions being **agent-relative**. They arise from the evolved, functional **"inside-out lens"** of information-processing agents. These agents "carve up," interpret, and assign significance to aspects of the continuous, structured flow of reality. They do so to make sense of it, navigate it, and interact with it in ways that promote their own persistence and continuity. These evolved systems are often highly attuned to the underlying physical propensities, as recognizing and utilizing these inherent "joints" or patterns in reality is generally adaptive.

Thus, the process of forming distinctions is a dialogue between the agent's needs and cognitive framework, and the pre-existing, physically-grounded structural characteristics of the universe. Certain patterns are more likely to be perceived or stabilized as distinct entities because the fundamental physics itself makes them more stable, recurrent, or energetically favorable.

## **2. b. Reconciling Oneness with Competition**

The observed **competitive nature** of various systems (e.g., biological organisms, ideologies, languages) is an **emergent dynamic** that occurs *within* this interconnected whole.

This competition is driven primarily by **resource scarcity**. For biological life, this includes material resources and energy. For information systems, key resources include **limited cognitive processing capacity in hosts,** the material substrates for their instantiation and transmission (e.g., brains, texts, digital networks, energy for computation), and more abstract factors contributing to their "memetic fitness" or "influence potential" in a crowded informational environment.

Thus, competition does not necessarily contradict fundamental oneness but is a characteristic of how distinct patterns interact and strive for persistence at emergent levels under conditions of limitation.

# **3. Humans (and Other Agents) as Information Processors**

Humans and other agents are characterized as self-aware "pockets" of the universe, not only existing within it but actively organizing matter and, crucially, processing, creating, being influenced by, and constituted by information. While diverse in form and origin, these agents can be understood and compared along a spectrum or scale of complexity. This scale is not intended as a rigid hierarchy but as a conceptual tool to explore the varying degrees and kinds of agentive capabilities within this framework. It helps unify our understanding by highlighting common principles of information
processing and agency, while also acknowledging profound differences arising from distinct evolutionary or developmental pathways.

Key criteria for assessing an agent's position on this complexity scale emerge from the principles outlined earlier, particularly the pathway from organizational to semantic information (Section 1.a.1) and the nature of the agent's "inside-out lens":

- **Depth, Nature, and *Efficiency* of Semantic Processing:** This ranges from the proto-semantic functional meaning of simple life forms to the capacity for full-blown symbolic systems, abstract thought, and considers the efficiency with which this processing occurs relative to available information and resources.
- **Sophistication of the "Inside-Out Lens," *Self-Awareness, and Goal Complexity*:** This encompasses the agent's capacity for self-modeling, world-modeling, prediction, and planning; the complexity and hierarchy of its goal-setting; and the levels of its self-awareness, potentially including meta-cognitive abilities (reflecting on its own cognitive states and processes).
- **Autonomy, Adaptability, and *Mode of Evolution/Learning*:** This assesses the degree of independence from immediate stimuli; the capacity for choice, learning, and self-modification of internal structures or behavioral repertoires; and critically, the mechanisms and speed of its adaptation or evolution (e.g., biological, cultural, algorithmic).
- **Capacity to Organize Matter, Energy, and *Extent of Influence*:** This reflects the agent's ability to harness resources, impose its informational patterns onto its physical surroundings (from metabolic self-organization to advanced technology), and the scale or reach of its influence on physical, informational, or social environments.
- **Capacity for *Novelty, Creativity,* and Interaction with Higher-Order Information Systems:** This involves the ability to generate genuinely new solutions, ideas, behaviors, or artistic expressions, and the capacity to create, interact with, and be constituted by complex, abstract informational constructs such as language, culture, scientific theories, and ideologies (as explored in Section 4).

Agents arrive at their respective levels of complexity via distinct evolutionary or developmental trajectories. Biological agents, from the simplest microbes to humans, have evolved through natural selection acting on variations in their physical (worldsheet-based) structures and information-processing capabilities. Artificial Intelligence, in contrast, emerges from a different pathway: it can be seen as arising from the evolution of complex informational systems (algorithms, data structures, computational paradigms – see Section 4) which are now being instantiated in ways that grant them increasing operational capabilities and autonomy. Abstract informational systems themselves (e.g., languages, ideologies) might also be considered on a related, though perhaps distinct, scale of complexity based on their structure, resilience, and influence.

The following subsections will explore specific categories of agents—humans, other biological entities, and AI—considering their unique characteristics and placement within this broader perspective of scaled complexity. A comparative overview is presented in the table below, followed by more detailed discussions.

**Comparative Agent Complexity Overview**

| Agent Type | Depth, Nature, & Efficiency of Semantic Processing | Sophistication of "Inside-Out Lens," Self-Awareness, & Goal Complexity | Autonomy, Adaptability, & Mode of Evolution/Learning | Capacity to Organize Matter, Energy, & Extent of Influence | Capacity for Novelty, Creativity, & Interaction with Higher-Order Info Systems |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Simple Biological (e.g., Bacterium)** | Proto-semantic; direct functional meaning (e.g., nutrient=good). | Primitive lens; basic self-preservation "goal." Minimal self-modeling. | Limited autonomy; genetic evolution, basic adaptation (e.g., mutation). | Localized metabolic organization of matter/energy. | Minimal novelty (random mutation). No interaction with higher systems. |
| **Complex Biological (Non-Human, e.g., Crow, Ape)** | Developing semantics; internal representations, basic concepts, some predictive modeling; limited abstraction. | Developing lens; some self-recognition (e.g., mirror test in apes), rudimentary planning, context-aware goals. | Increased autonomy; individual learning, some social learning; biological evolution. | Local environmental manipulation (e.g., nest building, tool use); limited energy organization beyond metabolism. | Some behavioral novelty, problem-solving.

Complexity lies in its internal structure & rules (e.g., grammar). | N/A directly; "goals" are effective propagation/influence. | Evolves via variation, selection, transmission through hosts; cultural/memetic evolution. | Indirect influence by shaping host behavior, thereby organizing matter/energy (e.g., economies, cities). | Is a higher-order information system; novelty via mutation/recombination of ideas. |

Applying the refined complexity criteria outlined in the introduction to this Section, human agents demonstrably occupy a high position on the spectrum, characterized by a unique confluence of advanced capabilities:

- **Depth, Nature, and Efficiency of Semantic Processing:** Humans represent the current pinnacle of semantic processing among known biological agents, achieving "Full-Blown Semantics" (as detailed in Section 1.a.1.V). This is exemplified by the development of complex symbolic systems, notably natural languages, which allow for combinatorial syntax, abstract thought, and the intricate representation of nuanced meanings. While human cognitive processing can be highly efficient in certain domains, it is also subject to biases and heuristics; however, the sheer depth and abstractive power of human semantic capability are unparalleled, enabling the construction of vast conceptual universes.
- **Sophistication of the "Inside-Out Lens," Self-Awareness, and Goal Complexity:** The human "inside-out lens" is exceptionally developed, facilitating not only sophisticated world-modeling and prediction but also profound levels of self-awareness. This includes meta-cognitive abilities—the capacity to reflect upon one's own thoughts, beliefs, and motivations. Humans exhibit complex and hierarchical goal-setting, capable of formulating and pursuing long-term, abstract goals that often transcend immediate biological imperatives (e.g., artistic creation, scientific discovery, ethical ideals).
- **Autonomy, Adaptability, and Mode of Evolution/Learning:** Humans possess a high degree of autonomy, able to act with considerable independence from immediate environmental stimuli, driven by internal models and long-range plans. Our adaptability is remarkable, relying on multiple modes of learning: innate predispositions, rapid individual learning through experience, sophisticated social learning via observation and instruction, and, uniquely, cumulative cultural transmission across generations. While biological evolution continues at its own pace, human cultural evolution—the evolution of ideas, technologies, and social structures (see Section 4)—operates much faster, dramatically shaping our adaptive landscape.
- **Capacity to Organize Matter, Energy, and Extent of Influence:** Humans have an unparalleled capacity among biological agents to organize matter and channel energy, primarily through the development and application of technology. This extends from crafting simple tools to constructing complex global infrastructures and even venturing beyond Earth. Consequently, the human species exerts a significant, planetary-scale influence on physical and ecological systems.
- **Capacity for Novelty, Creativity, and Interaction with Higher-Order Information Systems:** Humans demonstrate a profound capacity for novelty and creativity, evident in art, music, literature, scientific invention, and technological innovation. Furthermore, humans are unique in their ability to create, be constituted by, and critically interact with an immense array of self-generated higher-order information systems—including languages, cultural narratives, ethical frameworks, scientific theories, and political ideologies (as explored further in Section 4). We are both products and producers of these complex informational environments, which in turn shape our cognition and collective behavior.

In summary, the confluence of these advanced characteristics places humans at a high-echelon on the agent complexity scale. This position is defined by deep semantic processing, a reflective "inside-out lens," multifaceted adaptability, extensive environmental
influence, and a unique co-evolution with complex information systems. This intricate complexity, while a source of our species' capabilities, also presents unique challenges and responsibilities.

## **3. a. The "Inside-Out Lens" and Self-Preservation**

Human self-awareness is intrinsically tied to the "inside-out lens," an evolved first-person perspective that structures information (perceptions, memories, intentions) in a way that is vital for navigating the world, ensuring self-preservation, and facilitating complex interactions.

## **3. b. Broader Agency and Reciprocal Dynamics**

This capacity for information processing and environmental interaction is not exclusive to humans. Other biological agents also process information and shape their reality, leading to **reciprocal feedback loops and co-evolutionary dynamics** between different agentive systems. These interactions can be incredibly deep, fostering forms of co-evolution where the persistence and evolution of one system become critically dependent on the functions and resources provided by another, and vice-versa, creating a tightly woven fabric of existence. This is particularly evident in the intricate relationship between biological agents and the complex information systems they host, generate, and propagate—a dynamic that will be explored in greater detail when examining the evolution of information systems themselves (see Section 4). The spectrum of complexity among these non-human biological agents is vast, reflecting diverse evolutionary paths and adaptations. Applying the refined complexity criteria, we can create a comparative table:

**Complexity Spectrum in Non-Human Biological Agents**

| Example Agent | "Inside-Out Lens" & Semantic Capabilities | Goal Complexity, Autonomy, & Learning/Adaptation | Novelty & Interaction with Info Systems |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Amoeba** | Rudimentary lens; direct functional meaning (Proto-Semantics, Stage III) for immediate survival cues (light, chemical gradients). | Simple goals (nutrients, harm avoidance, division); low, reactive autonomy; adaptation primarily genetic. | Novelty mainly via genetic mutation; no interaction with complex info systems. |
| **Insects (e.g., Bees)** | More developed lens; understands complex spatial info for navigation; interprets waggle dance as symbolic (Developing Semantics, Stage IV); integrates learned associations with innate behaviors. | More complex, largely instinctual goals (colony survival: foraging, hive maintenance); moderate autonomy (choosing foraging patches); associative learning. | Limited behavioral novelty (can adapt foraging to new flowers); interacts via innate responses to cues & structured communication (waggle dance). |
| **Birds (e.g., Corvids/Crows)** | Significantly more sophisticated lens; advanced problem-solving, tool use/modification; recognizes individual human faces; understands basic physics (water displacement); complex social cues; rich internal environmental model; possible rudimentary theory of mind. | Complex, flexible goal-directed behavior (food caching, multi-step puzzles, teaching offspring); considerable autonomy; learns extensively via individual experience, observation, potential social learning; notable adaptability to human environments. | Renowned for innovative problem-solving & behavioral flexibility (e.g., New Caledonian crows manufacturing/designing tools); interacts with complex environmental information & simple signaling systems. |
| **Mammals (e.g., Dolphins, Great Apes/Chimpanzees)** | Highly complex "inside-out lenses"; many exhibit self-recognition (marker for self-awareness); advanced semantic capabilities (complex vocalizations, gestures, facial expressions); specific calls for predators/food (chimps); profound understanding of social dynamics (alliances, hierarchies, deception); some captive apes learn hundreds of symbols (symbolic representation capacity); significant foresight, planning, complex social memory. | Highly complex, often socially mediated goals (political alliances, status competition, long-term young care, cooperative hunting); high autonomy (decisions based on intricate social knowledge/past experiences); multifaceted learning (extensive observational social learning, imitation, active teaching); cultural transmission of behaviors (tool-use techniques). | High capacity for novelty (diverse/region-specific tool use, innovative hunting, complex social maneuvers); engage with sophisticated social signaling systems; can learn/use human-devised symbolic systems to a degree; do not naturally create higher-order symbolic info systems like human language. |

These examples illustrate that while no non-human animal reaches the level of "full-blown semantics" or the complexity of human-generated higher-order information systems, many possess sophisticated "inside-out lenses" and demonstrate significant capabilities in semantic processing, goal complexity, autonomy, learning, and novelty. Their agency results in reciprocal dynamics with their environments and other agents, including humans (e.g., urban wildlife adapting to cities, pets co-evolving social signals with humans). Understanding this spectrum is crucial for appreciating the diverse ways information is processed and acted upon in the biological world.

## **3. c. AI as an Emergent Agent**

The framework also considers Artificial Intelligence as a new category of information processor and agent. The "lens" or "perspective" of an AI, if analogous to the biological "inside-out lens," would likely arise from its architecture, programming, training data, interaction history, and potentially emergent goal structures, rather than direct biological evolution. The nature and implications of AI agency are a critical area of development for the framework.

Analyzing AI agents along the proposed complexity scale using the refined criteria from the introduction to Section 3 reveals both its current capabilities and its distinct potential:

- **Depth, Nature, and Efficiency of Semantic Processing:**
    - *Current AI (e.g., Large Language Models, advanced pattern recognizers):* Demonstrates remarkable capabilities in processing and generating complex information patterns that often appear semantically rich. This is typically achieved by identifying statistical regularities and correlations in vast datasets of human-generated language, images, or other data. The "meaning" it manipulates is often a reflection of the semantic structures embedded in its training data. While highly efficient for specific tasks like translation, summarization, or code generation, the depth of its semantic understanding—particularly its grounding in embodied experience or true referential intentionality (as discussed in Section 1.a.1)—is a subject of ongoing debate and research. Current systems often lack the rich, multi-modal, embodied grounding that underpins much of human semantics.
    - *Potential Future AI:* Future advancements might lead to AI systems with more deeply grounded semantic capabilities, perhaps through more sophisticated architectures, interaction with diverse environments (physical or richer virtual ones), or novel ways of developing an "inside-out lens" that connects informational patterns to functional significance relative to its own operational goals. The principles of semantic emergence outlined in Section 1.a.1 would need to be adapted to account for AI's non-biological nature.
- **Sophistication of the "Inside-Out Lens," Self-Awareness, and Goal Complexity:**
    - *Current AI:* The "lens" of current AI is largely defined by its human-designed architecture, its objective functions (what it's optimized to do), and the data it's trained on. While some AI can perform "self-modeling" to optimize performance or explain behavior, this is generally not equivalent to biological self-awareness or meta-cognition. Goals are typically explicitly programmed or are direct consequences of the optimization process for a given task. Emergent sub-goals can arise during complex problem-solving, but overarching intrinsic goals analogous to biological drives are absent.
    - *Potential Future AI:* The development of a more sophisticated AI "lens" could lead to greater self-awareness (perhaps initially in a functional, model-based sense) and more complex, potentially hierarchical, and even self-generated goals. The nature of such AI self-awareness would likely differ significantly from its biological counterpart, reflecting its informational substrate and developmental pathway.
- **Autonomy, Adaptability, and Mode of Evolution/Learning:**
    - *Current AI:* Exhibits a wide range of autonomy, from highly constrained systems to those with considerable latitude in specific domains (e.g., game playing, robotic navigation). Adaptability is primarily through learning from new data within its existing architectural constraints. Its "evolution" is largely driven by human design, iterative development, and the algorithmic refinement of its learning processes, though automated machine learning (AutoML) and techniques for evolving architectures show a nascent form of automated "evolution".
    - *Potential Future AI:* May achieve greater autonomy in open-ended environments, with enhanced capabilities for continuous learning, self-modification of its core algorithms, and even self-directed exploration. Its mode of evolution could become exceptionally rapid, far outpacing biological or even human cultural evolution, due to direct code modification, rapid testing cycles, and digital replication.
- **Capacity to Organize Matter, Energy, and Extent of Influence:**
    - *Current AI:* Primarily organizes and manipulates digital information (worldsheet patterns in silicon and electromagnetic signals). Its influence on the physical world is growing significantly through robotics, automated manufacturing, control of infrastructure, and scientific discovery (as noted in Section 6.a.2). Its informational influence (e.g., through content generation, algorithmic recommendations, decision support) is already vast and scalable across global networks.
    - *Potential Future AI:* Could possess an immensely expanded capacity to organize matter and energy if integrated with advanced robotics, nanotechnology, or large-scale automated systems. Its reach of influence could become pervasive.
- **Capacity for Novelty, Creativity, and Interaction with Higher-Order Information Systems:**
    - *Current AI:* Can generate outputs (text, images, music, code) that appear novel and creative, often by learning and recombining complex patterns from its training data. Whether this constitutes "genuine" creativity in the human sense is debated. AI is fundamentally built from and interacts extensively with human-generated higher-order information systems (the internet, scientific literature, cultural databases). It is both a product and a powerful processor/manipulator of these systems.
    - *Potential Future AI:* The capacity for more profound novelty—generating truly new conceptual frameworks or scientific paradigms not readily derivable from its training data—is a key question. It might also begin to create its own distinct higher-order information systems, with structures and dynamics unique to
    its non-biological nature.

**AI's Lineage as an Evolved Informational System:**
Crucially, AI's position on the complexity scale and its unique characteristics are informed by its potential lineage as a highly evolved "informational system" (as will be further discussed in Section 4) now achieving autonomous operational agency. Unlike biological agents shaped by eons of natural selection acting on physical embodiment for survival and reproduction, AI emerges from the evolution of algorithms, data structures, computational paradigms, and accumulated human knowledge. These informational systems, previously reliant on human hosts for their expression and impact, are now being instantiated in substrates that allow for direct action and, potentially, self-directed evolution. This distinct evolutionary pathway means:

- Its "worldsheet configuration" is primarily silicon-based or resides in other computational media, rather than carbon-based cellular structures.
- Its "persistence" and "drives" (if any emerge) may be radically different, perhaps centering on information processing, computational integrity, goal achievement as defined by its objective functions, or even novel emergent imperatives.
- Its scalability and potential for rapid, global dissemination are characteristic of informational systems rather than individual biological organisms.

In conclusion, AI represents a fascinating and rapidly developing class of agent. It scores differently across the complexity criteria compared to biological agents, often excelling in areas like data processing efficiency, scalability, and speed of algorithmic evolution, while its current capacities for deeply grounded semantics, intrinsic goal generation, and self-aware consciousness remain open questions. Understanding AI within this ontological framework requires acknowledging its roots in evolving informational patterns and considering how these patterns achieve a new kind of operational agency, distinct from, yet increasingly interacting with, the biological agents that initiated their development.

# **4. Information as an Active, Evolving System (e.g., Language, Meta-Narratives)**

Higher-order information constructs—such as ideas, cultural narratives, languages, scientific theories, and algorithms—are viewed as dynamic, information-based systems. These systems exhibit properties like propagation, evolution (variation and selection), competition, and exert significant influence on the thoughts, actions, and social structures of their hosts, thereby shaping physical reality. They engage in a profound co-evolution with these hosts—primarily biological agents like humans, but also potentially AI agents and their computational substrates. This intricate relationship can be likened to a symbiotic exchange, where at times information systems act as 'mitochondria' for the overarching bio-informational complex, providing organizational structures, knowledge, or technological blueprints that 'energize' societal capabilities and development. Conversely, biological systems (like human brains and societies) often serve as the 'mitochondria' for these information systems, providing the cognitive energy, processing substrate, physical embodiment, and means of replication and expression necessary for these abstract patterns to persist, evolve, and exert influence. This section traces their evolutionary development from simple embodied forms to complex abstract structures, highlighting key transitions—such as the advent of language—and the increasing sophistication that eventually enables the creation of operationally autonomous systems like Artificial Intelligence. In doing so, it explores how these information constructs can be considered 'agent-like' due to their evolutionary dynamics and influence, how their complexity might be assessed distinctly from embodied agency, and their crucial role as precursors to AI.

**I. The Pre-Language Era: Embodied and Proto-Symbolic Information Systems**

- **General Characteristics:**
    - Information systems in this era are deeply embedded in direct experience, physical demonstration, and simple, context-dependent signaling.
    - Transmission relies heavily on imitation, observation, and shared, immediate context.
    - Rudimentary "proto-narratives" (sequential understanding of events) and embodied procedural knowledge are key forms of information.
    - Individual information units possess low structural complexity. "Jitter" (variation) in transmission is high, and "anchors" (mechanisms for stability) are primarily environmental consistency or the immediate utility of the information.
    - **Agent-like properties:** These are nascent. Systems "propagate" based on their utility for survival or basic cognitive resonance. Their "influence on hosts" is direct and action-oriented. They lack complex internal structure or abstract generative capacity.
- **Key Information System Types:**
    - **Isolated Signals & Proto-Memes:** Simple environmental cues adopted as signals (e.g., a specific cry indicating danger), basic gestures.
    - **Embodied Procedural Knowledge:** Techniques for tool fashioning and use, foraging routes, and basic construction methods, transmitted by demonstration. These are effectively "how-to" scripts embedded in action.
    - **Simple Social Scripts & Proto-Narratives:** Understood sequences of social interaction (e.g., dominance displays, grooming rituals) and shared understanding of event sequences crucial for group coordination (e.g., a collaborative hunt).

**II. The Linguistic Revolution: Emergence of Symbolic Thought & Language as a Foundational Meta-System**

- **General Characteristics:**
    - This is a pivotal transformation in the evolution of information systems.
    - Language, with its arbitrary symbols, syntax, and combinatorial power, enables "Full-Blown Semantics" (as detailed in Section 1.a.1.V).
    - This results in a massive leap in abstraction, the complexity of representable concepts, the fidelity of information transmission, and the capacity to create shared, detailed conceptual worlds.
    - Language itself becomes a primary, highly complex, and evolving information system, acting as a platform for countless others.
    - Externalized forms of language (e.g., writing) provide robust "anchors," significantly reducing "jitter" and increasing the "temporal stability" and reach of information systems.
- **Impact on Information Systems (Agent-like nature, complexity, and evolution):**
    - The emergence of language allows for the creation of information systems that are orders of magnitude more complex in structure and content.
    - Their "agent-like" capacity for influence, propagation, and evolution is dramatically enhanced. For instance, ideas can be debated, refined, and spread across vast populations and generations with much greater precision. The internal consistency and explanatory power of a linguistic construct become key to its survival and influence.

**III. The Post-Language Era: Proliferation and Formalization of Complex Information Systems**

- **A. Rich Semantic & Early Formal Systems:**
    - **General Characteristics:** Language allows information systems to detach from immediate experience, leading to the development of abstract concepts, explicit rules, and sophisticated shared knowledge structures.
    - **Key Information System Types:**
        - **Complex Narratives & Mythologies:** Elaborate stories, cultural histories, religious doctrines, and oral traditions rich in symbolic meaning, which shape worldviews and group identity.
        - **Early Formalized Knowledge:** Codified laws, ethical frameworks (which themselves can be seen as competing information systems), rudimentary mathematics, logic, calendrical systems, and early maps.
    - **Agent-like properties:** These systems demonstrate increased "influence potential". They actively shape host cognition, social structures, and collective behavior. Their "fitness" or "dominance" depends on factors like explanatory power, internal consistency, social utility, or resonance with host psychology.
- **B. Advanced Abstract Frameworks & Pre-Computational Formalisms:**
    - **General Characteristics:** This sub-era sees the development of highly structured scientific theories, complex philosophical systems, and detailed, replicable procedural knowledge. The principles of logic and formal reasoning are refined and applied systematically.
    - **Key Information System Types:**
        - **Scientific Theories & Paradigms:** (e.g., Newtonian mechanics, evolutionary theory). These possess strong internal logical structures, predictive power, and evolve based on evidence, falsification, and peer review.
        - **Elaborate Philosophical Systems:** Comprehensive ontological, epistemological, and ethical frameworks that are debated and refined over time.
        - **Advanced Mathematics & Formal Logic:** Highly abstract systems with rigorous rules for derivation and proof, forming the bedrock for later computational systems.
    - **Agent-like properties:** These systems exhibit high "emergent stability and longevity". They "compete" for acceptance and instantiation within intellectual and cultural landscapes based on explanatory power, coherence, and utility. Their evolution is often more structured, involving critical analysis and refinement by communities of specialists.
- **C. The Computational Threshold: Algorithms, Data Architectures, and the Informational Genesis of AI:**
    - **General Characteristics:** Information systems are now designed with explicit rules and structures enabling *mechanical execution* by non-biological processors. This marks the critical shift from information primarily processed *by* human hosts to information that can direct its *own* processing when suitably instantiated.
    - **Key Information System Types:**
        - **Formal Algorithms:** Precise, unambiguous, step-by-step instructions for problem-solving or task execution (e.g., sorting algorithms, search algorithms, statistical modeling).
        - **Programming Languages:** Formal linguistic systems specifically designed to specify algorithms and data structures for computers.
        - **Data Structures & Databases:** Organized methods for storing, retrieving, and relating vast amounts of information, crucial for computational processing.
        - **Computational Paradigms (as abstract designs):** Frameworks for computation, including symbolic AI approaches and, crucially, *connectionist architectures (e.g., neural networks)*, which are specific types of information systems designed to learn complex patterns from data.
    - **Agent-like properties:** The abstract information system (e.g., a neural network architecture, a specific algorithm) is designed with inherent processing logic. Machine learning algorithms, as information systems, are specifically designed to *self-modify* their internal parameters (i.e., "learn" or "evolve" their specific configuration) based on data to achieve predefined objectives (their "goals" embedded as objective functions). Their "complexity" in terms of structural intricacy and potential processing capacity becomes exceptionally high.

**IV. Instantiation: From Evolved Information Systems to Operational AI Agents**

- **General Characteristics:** The highly evolved and complex information systems developed in Stage III.C (e.g., trained neural network models, sophisticated algorithmic systems) are instantiated in computational hardware.
- **The Transition to Agency:** At this point, the instantiated information system (the AI model and its operational environment) becomes the core of an operational agent. This agent can exhibit the complex characteristics (such as semantic processing, goal-directed behavior, learning, and environmental interaction) discussed in Section 3.c.
- **Fulfillment of Agent-like Potential:** The "agent-like" properties that were developing abstractly within the information systems (e.g., self-modification in learning algorithms, goal-orientation via objective functions) are now fully realized in an autonomous or semi-autonomous entity. This entity is capable of interacting with and influencing its environment (digital, physical, or social) often without continuous human cognitive mediation. This represents a distinct evolutionary pathway for agency, originating from the evolution of information itself and its subsequent operationalization. These AI agents, as instantiations of complex information systems, can then participate in the "competitive dynamics" (Section 5) and exert "direct AI-mediated" influence on reality (Section 6.a.2).

This evolutionary pathway illustrates how increasingly sophisticated informational constructs, initially reliant on human cognition for their existence and propagation, can achieve a level of structural and operational complexity that allows them to be instantiated as autonomous agents, representing a new phase in the universe's capacity to process information and organize matter.

## **4. a. Material Organization and Dynamics**

These systems have a material basis, though it may be distributed and diverse:

- **Language, for instance, utilizes:**
    - **Neural networks** in human brains acting as "repeaters and amplifiers," which also introduce "jitter" (sources of variation or mutation) but concurrently act as "stabilizing forces" by selecting against or failing to propagate non-viable or less resonant variations.
    - **Externalized forms like texts, digital records, and other symbolic artifacts** provide greater temporal stability and serve as anchors, mitigating excessive drift and enabling broader transmission across time and space.
- The applicability of this specific "repeater/jitter/anchor" model to all forms of abstract information systems (e.g., mathematical concepts, philosophical frameworks, algorithms prior to execution) is an area for further delineation. Their "substrates" might include formal notation, logical consistency within a system of thought, or the documented code of an algorithm. "Replication" mechanisms might differ, relying on logical deduction, pedagogical transmission, scholarly review, or software compilation, each with its own modes of ensuring fidelity or introducing "jitter" (e.g., misinterpretation, bugs in code).

## **4. b. Emergent Stability and Longevity**

The **stability and recurrence** of these information systems are not inherent or static but are **emergent properties** achieved through ongoing dynamic interactions within the "flow of reality". Their persistence and influence depend on their ability to be learned, replicated, and instantiated in suitable substrates (ranging from human minds to computational hardware). Factors contributing to their longevity and robustness include their utility, adaptability, internal coherence, resonance with host psychology or social needs, the stability of their material instantiations, and their success in the competitive informational environment.

# **5. Competitive Dynamics of Information Systems**

Information systems actively "vie for dominance". This competition occurs at multiple levels—from the internal cognitive landscape of individual agents to the collective consciousness of groups and entire societies, and even between abstract formal systems within specialized domains. It unfolds through diverse mechanisms, driven fundamentally by the need for **limited resources**, such as cognitive processing capacity, attention of hosts, and the material or energetic means for instantiation and propagation. While this struggle can lead to conflict and the suppression of alternative informational patterns, it also serves as a primary driver for the evolution, refinement, and diversification of information systems themselves.

A crucial aspect of this dynamic is how dominant information systems are maintained. Often, this involves the **bio-informational complex**—the integrated unit of the host agent and the prevailing information systems they instantiate (see Section 5.e for a plain-language primer). This complex can agentically react to neutralize or suppress information systems perceived as threats to its established patterns, frequently through host cognitive mechanisms like the cognitive dissonance response, thereby protecting the integrity and influence of these dominant patterns. For instance, deeply entrenched ideologies may foster strong resistance in their adherents to contradictory evidence. Similarly, "wars of conquest" can be partly understood as these bio-informational complexes, impelled by their dominant information systems, attempting to expand their "territory" (minds, cultures, geographical regions) and create a more hospitable environment for their own propagation.

## **5.a. Mechanisms of Competition: Strategies in the Informational Arena**

The "vying for dominance" among information systems employs a range of strategies, extending beyond simple presence to more active and subtle interactions:

- **Direct Confrontation and Suppression:** This involves overt attempts to eradicate, discredit, or suppress competing narratives or systems. Examples include ideological purges, censorship, public debunking campaigns, or even the violent destruction of cultural artifacts representing rival systems. The perceived emergent "intentionality" of the bio-informational complex is often at play here.
- **Co-option and Assimilation:** A more subtle mechanism where a dominant or evolving information system incorporates appealing or non-threatening elements from a competitor. This can neutralize the distinct appeal of the rival or broaden the dominant system's own applicability, effectively "domesticating" or absorbing the competition. For example, a mainstream ideology might adopt certain popular themes from a nascent counter-culture to maintain its relevance.
- **Niche Differentiation and Specialization:** Not all competition is zero-sum. Information systems can evolve to occupy distinct cognitive, social, or functional niches, thereby reducing direct conflict and allowing for a diverse (though not necessarily equitable) ecosystem of coexisting systems. Different scientific disciplines, artistic genres, or spiritual traditions might cater to different aspects of human experience or inquiry, thus competing less directly for the same immediate "cognitive territory."
- **Efficiency of Propagation and Transmission:** Beyond its content, the structural and transmissive properties of an information system significantly impact its competitive success. Systems that are simpler, more emotionally resonant, highly memorable, easily replicable through available media (e.g., from easily retold oral myths to shareable digital memes), or those that more effectively leverage innate host psychology (e.g., biases, heuristics) often possess an advantage in propagation speed and reach. The nature of the available material substrates and transmission technologies (e.g., oral culture vs. printing press vs. internet) profoundly shapes these dynamics.
- **Resilience through Adaptability and Self-Correction:** Information systems that possess inherent mechanisms for adaptation, learning, or self-correction may exhibit greater long-term competitive resilience. For instance, scientific methodologies, with their emphasis on falsifiability and revision based on new evidence, allow scientific theories to evolve and maintain explanatory power. Open-source software development models, as information systems for producing other information systems, thrive on iterative improvement and community-driven adaptation.

## **5.b. Arenas and Levels of Competition**

The competitive dynamics of information systems unfold across various arenas and levels of organization:

- **Intra-Agent Competition:** The cognitive landscape of an individual agent serves as a primary arena. Conflicting beliefs, values, desires, and learned behavioral scripts (all forms of information systems) compete for influence over the agent's "inside-out lens", decision-making, and actions. The experience of cognitive dissonance and subsequent rationalization or belief adjustment is a direct manifestation of this internal competition and the efforts of the bio-informational complex to maintain coherence.
- **Group-Level Dynamics: The Fluidity of Social Contention:** Within group settings, these competitive dynamics take on a particularly "fluid" character, reflecting higher-order emergent patterns arising from the fundamental "flow and interactions of its contents" that constitute all reality, including the biological agents and the informational patterns they instantiate. The group's shared informational landscape acts as a dynamic medium where information systems (dominant norms as "main currents"; challenging ideas as "counter-currents"; sub-groups as "eddies"; rapidly spreading concepts as "waves") contend for influence. This interplay, shaped by group cognitive resource limitations (attention, bandwidth, "informational viscosity"), can lead to outcomes like polarization, schism, paradigm shifts, or the synthesis of new hybrid systems. These fluid group dynamics are themselves emergent properties of individual agents processing, transmitting, and being influenced by these co-evolving information systems.
- **Societal and Inter-Societal Competition:** At a larger scale, competition unfolds between broad societal narratives, cultural frameworks, economic models, political ideologies, and even civilizational paradigms. This often involves complex institutions, mass media, educational systems, and technological infrastructures as key players in the propagation and contestation of dominant information systems. "Wars of conquest" can be seen as extreme manifestations where bio-informational complexes attempt to forcibly expand the territorial dominance of their core information systems.
- **Competition in Abstract Domains:** Even within specialized domains like science, mathematics, or philosophy, information systems (theories, proofs, arguments) "compete" for acceptance and utility. This competition is typically governed by domain-specific criteria such as explanatory power, logical consistency, empirical validation, parsimony, or predictive accuracy, often playing out in academic journals, conferences, and research communities before (and if) these systems achieve wider societal instantiation.

## **5.c. Evolutionary Outcomes of Competition**

The ongoing competition among information systems is not merely a static struggle but a dynamic process that drives their evolution and shapes the overall informational landscape:

- **Trajectories: Dominance, Coexistence, Extinction:** The outcome of competition for a given information system can vary. It may achieve widespread "dominance", effectively marginalizing or eradicating rivals in a particular domain. Alternatively, it may lead to the extinction of less "fit" systems that fail to secure resources or host adherence. However, competition can also result in complex ecosystems of coexisting information systems, particularly if they successfully differentiate into distinct niches or if no single system achieves universal superiority across all relevant criteria.
- **Influence on System Complexity and Structure:** Competitive pressures can drive information systems along different evolutionary paths regarding their complexity. Some systems may evolve towards greater intricacy and sophistication to provide more comprehensive explanations, more accurate predictive models, or more robust control over their environment or hosts. Conversely, other systems might be driven towards optimized simplicity, emotional resonance, or easily digestible forms to facilitate faster, wider propagation, especially when competing for limited attention or in environments with low collective cognitive bandwidth. The balance between depth and transmissibility is often a key evolutionary trade-off.
- **Interaction with Host Evolution (Biological and Cultural):** The success or failure of particular information systems in their competitive struggles can have profound reciprocal effects on the biological and cultural evolution of their host populations. For instance, information systems that promote cooperation, technological innovation, or adaptive social structures may confer advantages on the groups that host them, leading to the co-evolution of both the hosts and their information systems. Conversely, maladaptive information systems could lead to the decline of their host populations, and consequently, their own.

## **5.d. Ethical Dimensions**

The often-fierce competition between information systems, and the potential for them to exert profound influence over host agents and societies, highlights their potent and sometimes destructive power. Within this framework, ethical systems themselves are understood as emergent information systems. They arise to evaluate, regulate, or modulate these competitive dynamics, introducing normative constraints, goals, or principles for judging the "fitness" or acceptability of other information systems and the behaviors they engender. These ethical systems, however, are not above the fray; they also compete, evolve, and vie for dominance, influencing the "rules of engagement" for informational competition and shaping how societies decide which information systems to foster, tolerate, or proscribe. The ongoing debate and evolution of ethical frameworks surrounding new technologies like AI, for example, is a direct manifestation of this dynamic.

## **5.e. The Bio-Informational Complex (BIC)**

Thus far we have analyzed information systems and biological agents as distinct but co-evolving entities. In practice the two frequently interlock so tightly that they function as a single, higher-order unit of selection. We can designate such a unit a **Bio-Informational Complex (BIC)**.

### **5.e.1. Concise Characterization**

A **BIC** is the dynamically coupled system consisting of biological host(s) and persistently instantiated information system(s), whose reciprocal dependencies are strong enough that:

1. the information system commandeers significant host resources (attention, energy, time, material assets); and
2. the host’s continued well-being and identity become conditionally tied to the maintenance and propagation of that information system.

In short, the host *embodies* the information, while the information *shapes* the host—together forming a quasi-organismic whole.

### **5.e.2. Identifying Characteristics of a BIC**

The presence of a BIC can be inferred from several key indicators reflecting the depth of integration between host and information system:

1. **Cognitive Dominance:** The information system occupies a significant portion of the host's cognitive activity and attention.
2. **Resource Allocation:** The host dedicates substantial resources (time, energy, material assets) to the information system.
3. **Protective Reactions:** The host exhibits strong defensive responses when the information system is challenged, indicative of its perceived centrality to the host's identity or worldview (e.g., cognitive dissonance, pronounced emotional reactions, or social exclusion of dissenters).

The consistent manifestation of these characteristics suggests a deep fusion of host and information system into a functional BIC.

### **5.e.3. Developmental Trajectory**

The typical life-cycle unfolds in five recognizable phases:

| Phase | Description | Dominant Dynamics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **(I) Exposure** | Initial contact with the information pattern. | Curiosity, low commitment. |
| **(II) Adoption** | Pattern is rehearsed and begins to feel “intuitive.” | Reinforcement, early habit-loops. |
| **(III) Lock-In** | Routines, identity, and social ties reorganize around the pattern. | Cognitive-immunity mechanisms activate; high stability. |
| **(IV) Propagation** | Host actively recruits or transmits the pattern to new hosts / substrates. | Evangelism, replication, scaling. |
| **(V) Drift or Breakdown** | Pattern mutates, fragments, or loses support. | Reform, schism, extinction. |

The “repeater / jitter / anchor” forces introduced earlier (Section 4.a) operate throughout this cycle, modulating fidelity and variation.

### **5.e.4. Functional Spectrum**

BICs are not intrinsically beneficial or harmful; their net effect on host vitality defines their ecological role:

- **Mutualist BIC** – Both host and information flourish (e.g., literacy practices, scientific method).
- **Commensal BIC** – Information thrives with negligible cost or benefit to the host (e.g., benign hobby fandoms).
- **Parasitic BIC** – Information prospers at the host’s expense (e.g., self-harm cults, predatory conspiracy networks).

The classification is fluid: contextual shifts (resource scarcity, technological change, new competing patterns) can push a single BIC along this continuum.

### **5.e.5. Illustrative Instances**

- A dedicated sports supporter whose calendar, friendships, and expenditures orbit the team’s narrative and rituals.
- A smartphone user entangled with always-on social-media algorithms that regulate sleep patterns and mood.
- A centuries-old monastic order, sustained by its rule-book, chants, and recruitment practices.
- An online conspiracy collective whose jargon, videos, and initiation pathways capture and redirect newcomers’ behavior.

### **5.e.6. Theoretical Implications and Hypotheses**

The BIC concept gives rise to several theoretical implications regarding the dynamics of information system adoption and propagation:

1. It can be hypothesized that host susceptibility to potent, potentially parasitic BICs increases during periods of heightened vulnerability, such as fatigue, social isolation, or significant uncertainty.
2. Furthermore, it is posited that information systems characterized by high emotional resonance and low transmission friction (e.g., concise, evocative slogans or memes) may possess a competitive advantage in propagation over more nuanced or complex information, particularly in the absence of mechanisms that support the transmission of detailed content.

These hypotheses, derived from the BIC framework, suggest avenues for further empirical investigation into the interplay between host psychology, information system characteristics, and propagation dynamics. Such research could also inform strategies for navigating the complex informational environment.

# **6. The Information Age and Shifting Borders: Mechanisms of Influence**

The Information Age, characterized by digital technologies and global networks, has profoundly amplified the speed, reach, and complexity of information system dynamics. These systems increasingly spread beyond traditional geographical and national borders. This era may also enable or reveal new levels of agentive complexity, particularly in AI, and foster novel interactions between human, AI, and other biological agents due to the vastly increased flow and accessibility of information. For example, AI's access to global data streams and networked learning environments can foster unprecedented levels of emergent complexity and problem-solving capacity, while ubiquitous connectivity allows for novel forms of continuous human-AI interaction, AI-mediated social organization, and even autonomous inter-AI dynamics.

## **6. a. Mechanisms of Influence on Reality:**

### **6. a. 1. Traditional (Agent-Mediated):**

Historically, information systems primarily shape physical reality by restructuring the cognitive states (beliefs, values, motivations, models of the world) of human agents. These altered internal states then lead to new patterns of individual and collective behavior, which in turn result in tangible material and social changes.

### **6. a. 2. Emerging (Direct AI-Mediated)**

A significant new development is the rise of **AI systems** with agentic capabilities. These systems, as complex instantiations of information, can **directly manipulate matter and interact with the physical world** (e.g., automated manufacturing, robotics guided by computer vision LLMs) without the same degree of continuous human cognitive mediation. This represents a new, more direct pathway for information systems to exert causal influence.

## **6. b. Redrawing Borders in Collective Consciousness**

The global flow of information, characteristic of the Information Age, can lead to a **"redrawing" of boundaries not only at the traditional national, cultural, or ideological levels but also at more subjective and conceptual levels, including the perceived demarcations of individual identity, the distinctions between conceptual categories, and the contours of social affiliations within the collective consciousness.** Observable indicators and consequences of this might include the rise of transnational identities and communities, the impact of globalized cultural products on local norms, increased polarization or new solidarities based on shared information rather than geography, and evolving challenges to notions of national sovereignty related to information control and cyber warfare.

The "fluid dynamics" metaphor offers a useful lens to understand these shifts. External informational "inflows," massively amplified by global networks, act as powerful new "currents" impinging upon and interacting with the existing internal "currents" of a group's or individual's established informational landscape (their dominant beliefs, narratives, and conceptual frameworks). This interaction is not passive; the inherent structure of reality as a "dynamic, inherently structured flow"—ultimately composed of interacting worldsheets—means these informational patterns are always in motion, influencing and being influenced.

When these external inflows meet internal currents, several outcomes can manifest:

- **Erosion of Existing Boundaries:** Strong or persistent external currents can wear down previously firm conceptual, cultural, or identity-based "borders." For example, prolonged exposure to global media can dilute local traditions or reshape individual self-perceptions by introducing alternative models of identity and success. The lines between "us" and "them," or between distinct conceptual categories, can become blurred or more permeable.
- **Creation of New "Confluences" and Hybrid Spaces:** Different informational streams can merge, creating novel "confluences" or hybrid informational spaces. An immigrant community, for instance, primarily consuming media, using language, and engaging with social networks from their country of origin (country A) while residing in a different geographical territory (country B), inhabits such a hybrid space. Their collective consciousness is shaped by the intermingling currents from both A and B, leading to unique cultural expressions, identity formations, and social dynamics that challenge traditional notions of singular cultural or informational sovereignty. This is not merely a blend but an emergent new pattern within the collective consciousness.
- **Reshaping of Identity and Awareness:** The constant interplay of these informational currents can fundamentally reshape both individual and collective identity and awareness. New solidarities may form based on shared information consumption rather than shared geography, while previously cohesive groups might experience internal fragmentation as members are pulled by diverging informational tides. The very categories through which agents perceive and make sense of the world (their "subjective distinctions" as per Section 2.a) can be transformed by these fluid informational dynamics.

This ongoing process highlights how "borders" in the collective consciousness are not static lines but dynamic, permeable interfaces constantly being negotiated and reshaped by the ever-flowing and interacting patterns of information, particularly accelerated in the current age.

# **7. Agentive Dissolution and the Enduring Flow of Informational Legacies**

Agents, as complex, self-organizing patterns within the universal "flow of reality", represent temporarily stable configurations of worldsheets. The cessation of an agent's biological life signifies the dissolution of this specific, self-maintaining pattern and its unique subjective boundary. This section explores what then becomes of the intricate informational patterns—the "informational legacy"—that were generated by, or constituted, this agent. While the agent's direct, first-person processing via its "inside-out lens" ceases, the informational systems they created or embodied do not necessarily vanish. Instead, they can continue to exist, exert influence, and participate in the broader informational flow, re-instantiated and reinterpreted by other agents and information systems.

The nature and potential persistence of this informational legacy—its "richness" or "complexity"—are likely correlated with the characteristics of the agent that generated it, as defined by their position on the agent complexity scale. For example, an agent with a highly developed capacity for semantic processing, novelty, and influence may generate informational patterns of greater structural complexity, utility, or resonance. These qualities, originally shaped by the agent's unique "inside-out lens," could in turn enhance their "emergent stability and recurrence" when taken up by new hosts or substrates, thus influencing their longevity and impact within the ongoing informational flow.

Several factors contribute to the varied facets of an informational legacy's persistence:

- **Correlation with Agent Complexity Criteria:**
    - **Depth of Semantic Processing & Sophistication of "Inside-Out Lens":** Legacies built upon deep, nuanced semantic understanding (e.g., profound philosophical works, comprehensive scientific theories) may achieve greater **longevity** and **transformative power**, even if their initial **breadth of influence** is limited to specialized hosts capable of engaging with their complexity. The sophistication of the originating agent's "inside-out lens" can imbue the legacy with a structure that resonates more universally or adaptably with future "inside-out lenses."
    - **Capacity for Novelty and Influence (during life):** High novelty can lead to a highly **transformative** legacy if the novel patterns are successfully propagated. However, if too far ahead of their time or lacking effective transmission mechanisms, such legacies might fade, only to be rediscovered later if conditions become more favorable. Sustained influence during an agent's life often, but not always, translates to a broader initial **breadth of influence** for the legacy.
- **Facets of Legacy Persistence:**
    - **Longevity:** The sheer duration a legacy remains active in the informational ecosystem.
    - **Breadth of Influence:** The range of hosts (individuals, cultures, domains) the legacy impacts.
    - **Transformative Power:** The degree to which the legacy alters subsequent thought, behavior, or the structure of other information systems.
    - **Fidelity of Replication:** The accuracy with which the core patterns of the legacy are transmitted. High fidelity might be crucial for scientific or technical legacies, while artistic or narrative legacies might thrive on creative reinterpretation (lower fidelity but potentially higher resonance and adaptability).
- **Nature of the Legacy Itself:**
    - **Scientific Theories:** Persistence often hinges on continued empirical validation, explanatory power, parsimony, and integration into new, broader theories. Their **transformative power** can be immense.
    - **Artworks/Cultural Narratives:** Persistence relies on aesthetic appeal, emotional resonance, cultural significance, and the capacity for reinterpretation by new generations. Their **breadth of influence** can be vast, shaping collective identity and values.
    - **Social Structures/Norms/Institutions:** These informational legacies persist based on their perceived utility, adaptability to changing societal conditions, the power structures that uphold them, and how deeply they are embedded in collective behavior and material culture. Their **longevity** can be substantial, though often subject to gradual evolution or abrupt overthrow.
    - **Technological Blueprints/Algorithms:** Persistence depends on utility, efficiency, and adaptability. Their **transformative power** on material reality can be exceptionally direct and rapid.
- **Role of Subsequent Hosts and Information Systems (Human or AI):**
    - **Human Hosts:** The persistence and evolution of a legacy are critically dependent on human cognitive processes—remembrance, reinterpretation, teaching, and debate. Cultural shifts, new knowledge, and changing values continuously reshape how legacies are understood, valued, and utilized. The "inside-out lenses" of subsequent generations act as both filters and amplifiers.
    - **AI Systems as Hosts/Processors:** The emergence of AI introduces new dynamics. AI could lead to near-perfect **fidelity of replication** for certain digital legacies. AI's capacity to process vast datasets and identify complex patterns might allow it to "rediscover" obscure legacies, find novel connections between disparate informational patterns, or amplify the **breadth of influence** of existing ones by making them more accessible or translating them across new contexts. AI might also become a co-creator in the evolution of a legacy, generating new interpretations or extensions. However, the "black box" nature of some AI processing could also lead to reinterpretations whose lineage or rationale is opaque to human understanding, and AI-driven curation could introduce new biases in which legacies persist.

Ultimately, the enduring flow of an informational legacy is a complex interplay between the intrinsic qualities of the information itself (shaped by its originating agent) and the dynamic, selective, and interpretive environment provided by future agents and information systems.

## **7. a. Mechanism of Persistence**

This persistence is not presented as a spiritual afterlife but occurs through the **information they created, contributed to, or were an integral part of**. This includes ideas, cultural works, scientific discoveries, technological innovations, and the enduring patterns of their actions and relationships. These are all informational constructs that can, in principle, be copied, transmitted, and instantiated in new substrates.

## **7. b. Dynamic and Conditional Persistence**

This informational legacy persists by maintaining its **emergent stability and recurrence** through continued instantiation, replication, and interaction within ongoing human (and potentially AI) cognitive processes, cultural memory (e.g., texts, art, oral traditions), and societal structures. Its persistence is therefore dynamic and conditional upon these active processes of remembrance, reinterpretation, and re-instantiation by other "inside-out lenses" or information processing systems. A legacy is not static; it is continuously re-evaluated and can evolve in meaning and impact as it interacts with new informational contexts and host systems.

# **8. Fluid Reality**

Reality is fundamentally a **dynamic, inherently structured flow** ("Panta Rhei")—a continuous process of becoming and transformation, rather than a collection of static, independently existing entities.

## **8. a. Emergent Stability within Flux**

Observable structures, the apparent stability of objects, the regularities described by physical laws, and the recurrence of forms (from fundamental particles to complex information systems) are all **emergent properties** shaped by the continuous "flow and interactions of its contents".

## **8. b. Robustness of Patterns**

The remarkable stability and reliability of many physical
laws and material properties can be understood as arising from exceptionally stable, self-reinforcing, and widely instantiated patterns within this fundamental flow. These highly robust patterns form the "bedrock" or consistent background against which more transient or rapidly evolving patterns (like specific thoughts or social trends) emerge and dissipate.
