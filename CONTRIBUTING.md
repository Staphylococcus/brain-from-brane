# Contributing to Brain from Brane Ontology

We welcome contributions to the Brain from Brane ontology framework! This document outlines how you can contribute to expanding and refining this comprehensive informational framework.

## Types of Contributions

### 1. Theoretical Refinements
- Clarifications or extensions to core concepts
- New subsections exploring specific aspects
- Integration with other philosophical or scientific frameworks
- Critiques and alternative perspectives

### 2. Operationalization Expansions
- New measurement frameworks for under-operationalized concepts
- Validation studies for existing instruments (ACAP, BIC, etc.)
- Pilot implementations and empirical testing
- Statistical analyses and psychometric validation

### 3. Case Studies and Applications
- Real-world applications of the framework
- Detailed case studies using BIC or ACAP assessments
- Cross-cultural validation studies
- Industry or domain-specific adaptations

### 4. Technical Improvements
- Documentation enhancements
- Navigation and structure improvements
- Interactive tools or visualizations
- Translation to other languages

## Getting Started

1. **Read the Framework**: Familiarize yourself with the core ontology, starting with the [README](README.md)
2. **Identify Your Interest**: Choose an area where you'd like to contribute
3. **Check Existing Work**: Review relevant sections to understand current development
4. **Propose Your Contribution**: Open an issue to discuss your planned contribution

## Contribution Guidelines

### For Theoretical Content

- Use precise terminology as defined in the [Glossary](docs/glossary.md)
- Provide clear reasoning and evidence for new concepts
- Follow the established document structure and formatting

### For Measurement Frameworks
- Follow the [Operationalization Template](docs/operationalization-template.md)
- Include validation protocols and empirical testing plans
- Provide concrete examples and assessment protocols
- Consider reliability, validity, and practical implementation

### For Empirical Studies
- Clearly describe methodology and sample characteristics
- Report results transparently, including limitations
- Discuss implications for framework development
- Share raw data when possible (with appropriate permissions)
