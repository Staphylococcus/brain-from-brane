H5: CRITICAL DESTABILIZATION BY LOW-COUNT CORRELATED GEOMETRIC DEFECTS
Tests Hypothesis 5: Critical Destabilization by Low-Count Correlated Geometric Defects.
This experiment investigates if the CV of actual execution time shows a localized peak
when a small, critical number of correlated geometric defects (lines) are introduced,
compared to point defects or different counts of line defects.
