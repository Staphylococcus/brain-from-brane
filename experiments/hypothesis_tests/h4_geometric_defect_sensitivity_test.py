H4: GEOMETRIC DEFECT SENSITIVITY TEST (Refined)
Tests Hypothesis 4: "Geometric Defect Sensitivity" in Information Structures.
This experiment investigates if the CV of *actual execution time* for processing a 
regular "information crystal" (e.g., a simulated 2D grid with CPU-bound work per cell)
shows distinct responses to different types and densities of "geometric defects."
