H2: GEOMETRIC ORDER STABILITY TEST
Tests Hypothesis 2: "Outward Stabilization" Effect of Information Geometry on Algorithmic Execution Stability.
This experiment investigates if algorithms processing data structures with higher
"internal information-geometric order" (e.g., a balanced tree vs. a skewed tree)
exhibit lower Coefficient of Variation (CV) in their execution time.
