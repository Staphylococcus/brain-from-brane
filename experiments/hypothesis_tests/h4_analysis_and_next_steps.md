## 2. Key Observations & Interpretations

### 2.1. General Observations
*   **Baseline Execution Time:** The baseline (no defects) processing time was ~0.96 seconds, aligning with the target for `BUSY_WORK_ITERATIONS_PER_WORK_UNIT = 10000`.
*   **Mean Execution Time Scaling:** Mean execution times generally increased with defect density for both point and line defects, as expected due to the higher work units in defective cells.

### 2.2. Point Defects
*   **CV Behavior:** The Coefficient of Variation (CV) for point defects remained consistently low (0.0009 - 0.0018) across all densities.
    *   **Ontology Proponent View:** This supports the idea that isolated, uncorrelated defects do not significantly disrupt the overall "processing rhythm" or "crystallographic stability" of the information structure. The system remains stable and predictable.
    *   **Conventional View:** This is expected. With a CPU-bound task, random placement of a small number of "slow spots" in a large grid should lead to highly consistent total execution times. The variability is minimal because the bulk of the processing is uniform.

### 2.3. Line Defects - The Anomaly
*   **CV Behavior:** A significant spike in CV was observed for line defects at densities corresponding to 1 actual defective line (specifically, input densities 0.005 and 0.010 in the script, which both translate to `num_defective_lines = 1` due to current logic). The CVs were 0.030466 and 0.026858 respectively.
    *   For other line defect densities (0.001, also 1 line; 0.020, 2 lines; 0.050, 5 lines; 0.100, 10 lines), the CV returned to low levels (0.0012 - 0.0022).

*   **Interpreting the CV Spike (Densities 0.005 & 0.010 for Line Defects):**
    *   **Ontology Proponent View:** This is a potentially exciting finding! This localized increase in CV for *extended, correlated* defects (lines) could signify a critical threshold where the "information crystal's" ability to predictably process information is compromised. The geometry of the defect interacts with the processing flow in a way that introduces significant instability (higher relative variability). This could be a manifestation of the predicted "geometric defect sensitivity" or a precursor to a "phase transition" in processing stability.
    *   **Conventional View & Anomaly Investigation:** The immediate puzzle is why densities 0.005 and 0.010 (both resulting in 1 line defect) show high CV, while density 0.001 (also resulting in 1 line defect) shows low CV. 
        *   **Hypothesis for Anomaly:** Given that these three density inputs all lead to the `introduce_line_defects` function creating a grid with *exactly one* defective line, the resulting processing grid should be statistically similar for each of the 2 instances run per density. The significantly different CVs suggest either:
            1.  **Statistical Fluke:** With only 2 instances and 3 iterations per instance, we might be seeing random noise, particularly if some specific line placements (e.g., a middle row vs. an edge row) have slightly different impacts that aren't averaged out.
            2.  **Subtle Code Logic Issue:** There might be an unexpected interaction in how `density` is used beyond just determining `num_defective_lines`, although this seems unlikely on first review of `run_single_config_test` and `introduce_line_defects`.
            3.  **Systemic Noise:** The 1-second processing time, while better, might still be borderline for robustly distinguishing these CVs if there was some intermittent system activity during those specific runs.

## 3. Planned Next Steps

1.  **Investigate the Line Defect CV Anomaly (1-line defect configurations):**
    *   **Action:** Modify the script to print the *actual* `num_defective_lines` calculated within `introduce_line_defects` for each density run to absolutely confirm it's 1 for densities 0.001, 0.005, and 0.010.
    *   **Action:** Temporarily modify the script to focus *only* on line defects at input densities 0.001, 0.005, and 0.010.
    *   **Action:** For these specific densities, increase `NUM_ITERATIONS_PER_CONFIG` (e.g., to 10-20) and `NUM_INSTANCES_PER_DEFECT_DENSITY` (e.g., to 5-10) to see if the CV values stabilize and converge, or if the discrepancy persists. This will help rule out statistical fluke.

2.  **If the CV Spike is Confirmed & Robust for Specific Line Defect Counts:**
    *   **Action:** Explore a finer granularity of `num_defective_lines` (e.g., specifically test 1 line, 2 lines, 3 lines, etc., by directly controlling this parameter rather than via `density` if the anomaly is linked to specific small counts of lines).
    *   **Action:** Consider if the *type* of line defect (row vs. column, or specific positions) has a differential impact, although the current random placement should average this out with enough instances.

3.  **Plotting:**
    *   **Action:** Once the anomaly is understood or resolved, plot CV vs. Defect Density (or CV vs. `num_defective_lines`) for both point and line defects to visually represent the findings.

4.  **Re-evaluate Ontology Predictions:**
    *   **Action:** Based on more robust data, refine the interpretation from both the ontology proponent and conventional perspectives.

## 4. Broader Implications (Premature but for consideration)

If the CV spike for specific line defect configurations proves robust, it *could* lend tentative support to the ontology's claim that the geometry of information structures and their defects has non-trivial, measurable impacts on processing dynamics and stability. However, much more rigorous investigation is needed.
