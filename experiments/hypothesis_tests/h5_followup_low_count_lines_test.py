H5 Follow-up: INVESTIGATE LOW CV FOR 2 LINE DEFECTS
This experiment is a follow-up to H5 to specifically investigate the low CV observed
for 2 line defects with higher statistical confidence.
It focuses only on line defects with counts 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4,
using increased iterations and instances per configuration.

MODIFIED FOR TEMPERATURE LOGGING: This version will only run the baseline (0 defects)
configuration and log CPU temperatures during that run.

MODIFIED FOR FULL RUN: This version will run line defect counts [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
with higher iterations and instances. Temperature logging is disabled.
