H5 Follow-up: INVESTIGATE LOW CV FOR 2 LINE DEFECTS
This experiment is a follow-up to H5 to specifically investigate the low CV observed
for 2 line defects with higher statistical confidence.
It focuses only on line defects with counts 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4,
using increased iterations and instances per configuration.
