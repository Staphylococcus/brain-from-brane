Understanding the material organization of information systems—including active R/J/A dynamics and the influence of **[self-stabilizing patterns](../../glossary/O.md#outward-stabilization-propensity)**—reveals key principles governing their development:

### Coevolution of Substrates and Information Patterns
Information systems and their material bases (e.g., brains, computational hardware, social structures) **co-evolve**. Substrates adapt to better support and propagate successful information patterns, while information patterns evolve to better leverage the capabilities of their substrates. For instance, biological brains develop specialized regions for processing certain types of information (like language), and digital technologies are optimized for specific data structures and algorithms. Successful [self-stabilizing patterns](../../glossary/O.md#outward-stabilization-propensity) become deeply embedded within their supporting substrates.

### Selection Pressures Based on Compatibility and Efficiency
The characteristics of material substrates create **selection pressures**. Information patterns that are more compatible with a substrate's existing structure or operational logic—or that can be maintained and propagated more efficiently by that substrate—are favoured. Costly or specialised substrates may only support information patterns that demonstrate high utility or a strong ability to integrate. The ease with which a pattern can be adopted and utilised by a substrate influences its evolutionary success.

### Cross-Substrate Competition and Resilience
Information systems compete for adoption and influence across various substrates. Patterns that are more readily adaptable to, or compatible with, a wider range of substrates may out-compete more specialised ones. New technologies can create opportunities for information patterns to migrate to new substrates. Systems that achieve stability and influence across multiple substrates often gain **resilience**. The ability of a [self-stabilizing pattern](../../glossary/O.md#outward-stabilization-propensity) to organise or be adopted by diverse substrates is a key factor in its competitive success.

### Complementarity of Active Dynamics and Structural Influence
Information systems exhibit both **active evolutionary dynamics** (driven by R/J/A processes like variation and transmission) and the **passive structural influence** of their self-stabilised forms. This complementarity enables both adaptive evolution (innovation and change) and foundational stability (persistence of core structures). Active processes drive exploration and adaptation, while the inherent structure of successful [self-stabilizing patterns](../../glossary/O.md#outward-stabilization-propensity) provides a robust framework that guides development and ensures coherence.

### Evolution Towards Enhanced Stability and Influence
Successful information systems often evolve characteristics that enhance their ability to achieve self-stabilisation and to organise or integrate with new substrates they encounter. This can create evolutionary advantages for patterns that can rapidly establish themselves and exert structural influence in malleable environments, leading to accelerating adoption and broader organisational impact.
