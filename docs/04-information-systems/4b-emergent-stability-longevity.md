# **4.b. Emergent Stability and Longevity**

The **[stability and recurrence](../glossary.md#stability-and-recurrence)** of these information systems are not inherent or static but are **[emergent properties](../glossary.md#emergent-properties)** achieved through ongoing dynamic interactions within the "[flow of reality](../glossary.md#flow-of-reality)". Their persistence and influence depend on their ability to be learned, replicated, and instantiated in suitable substrates (ranging from human minds to computational hardware). Factors contributing to their longevity and robustness include their utility, adaptability, internal coherence, resonance with host psychology or social needs, the stability of their material instantiations, and their success in the competitive informational environment.
