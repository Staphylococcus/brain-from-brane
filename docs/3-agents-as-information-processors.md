# Agents as Information Processors

Humans and other agents are characterized as self-aware "pockets" of the universe, not only existing within it but actively organizing matter and, crucially, processing, creating, being influenced by, and constituted by information. While diverse in form and origin, these agents can be understood and compared along a spectrum or scale of complexity. This scale is not intended as a rigid hierarchy but as a conceptual tool to explore the varying degrees and kinds of agentive capabilities within this framework. It helps unify our understanding by highlighting common principles of information processing and agency, while also acknowledging profound differences arising from distinct evolutionary or developmental pathways.

Key criteria for assessing an agent's position on this complexity scale emerge from the principles outlined earlier, particularly the pathway from organizational to semantic information and the nature of the agent's "inside-out lens":

- **Depth, Nature, and Efficiency of Semantic Processing:** This ranges from the proto-semantic functional meaning of simple life forms to the capacity for full-blown symbolic systems, abstract thought, and considers the efficiency with which this processing occurs relative to available information and resources.
- **Sophistication of the "Inside-Out Lens," Self-Awareness, and Goal Complexity:** This encompasses the agent's capacity for self-modeling, world-modeling, prediction, and planning; the complexity and hierarchy of its goal-setting; and the levels of its self-awareness, potentially including meta-cognitive abilities (reflecting on its own cognitive states and processes).
- **Autonomy, Adaptability, and Mode of Evolution/Learning:** This assesses the degree of independence from immediate stimuli; the capacity for choice, learning, and self-modification of internal structures or behavioral repertoires; and critically, the mechanisms and speed of its adaptation or evolution (e.g., biological, cultural, algorithmic).
- **Capacity to Organize Matter, Energy, and Extent of Influence:** This reflects the agent's ability to harness resources, impose its informational patterns onto its physical surroundings (from metabolic self-organization to advanced technology), and the scale or reach of its influence on physical, informational, or social environments.
- **Capacity for Novelty, Creativity, and Interaction with Higher-Order Information Systems:** This involves the ability to generate genuinely new solutions, ideas, behaviors, or artistic expressions, and the capacity to create, interact with, and be constituted by complex, abstract informational constructs such as language, culture, scientific theories, and ideologies.

Agents arrive at their respective levels of complexity via distinct evolutionary or developmental trajectories. Biological agents, from the simplest microbes to humans, have evolved through natural selection acting on variations in their physical structures and information-processing capabilities. Artificial Intelligence, in contrast, emerges from a different pathway: it can be seen as arising from the evolution of complex informational systems (algorithms, data structures, computational paradigms) which are now being instantiated in ways that grant them increasing operational capabilities and autonomy. Abstract informational systems themselves (e.g., languages, ideologies) might also be considered on a related, though perhaps distinct, scale of complexity based on their structure, resilience, and influence.

The following subsections will explore specific categories of agents—humans, other biological entities, and AI—considering their unique characteristics and placement within this broader perspective of scaled complexity. A comparative overview is presented in the table below, followed by more detailed discussions.

**Comparative Agent Complexity Overview**

| Agent Type | Depth, Nature, & Efficiency of Semantic Processing | Sophistication of "Inside-Out Lens," Self-Awareness, & Goal Complexity | Autonomy, Adaptability, & Mode of Evolution/Learning | Capacity to Organize Matter, Energy, & Extent of Influence | Capacity for Novelty, Creativity, & Interaction with Higher-Order Info Systems |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Simple Biological (e.g., Bacterium)** | Proto-semantic; direct functional meaning (e.g., nutrient=good). | Primitive lens; basic self-preservation "goal." Minimal self-modeling. | Limited autonomy; genetic evolution, basic adaptation (e.g., mutation). | Localized metabolic organization of matter/energy. | Minimal novelty (random mutation). No interaction with higher systems. |
| **Complex Biological (Non-Human, e.g., Crow, Ape)** | Developing semantics; internal representations, basic concepts, some predictive modeling; limited abstraction. | Developing lens; some self-recognition (e.g., mirror test in apes), rudimentary planning, context-aware goals. | Increased autonomy; individual learning, some social learning; biological evolution. | Local environmental manipulation (e.g., nest building, tool use); limited energy organization beyond metabolism. | Some behavioral novelty, problem-solving. Rudimentary interaction with simple signaling systems. |
| **Human Agent** | Full-blown semantics; language, symbolic systems, abstract thought, complex model building; efficiency variable. | Highly developed lens; meta-cognition, rich self-awareness, complex/hierarchical/abstract/long-term goals. | High autonomy; rapid individual & social learning, cumulative cultural evolution, technological augmentation; slower biological evolution. | Significant global organization of matter/energy via technology; planetary-scale physical influence. | Profound novelty & creativity (art, science, tech). Creates, constituted by, & extensively interacts with complex symbolic/cultural higher-order information systems. |
| **AI Agent (Current/Near-Future)** | Primarily statistical/correlational semantics derived from vast data; limited grounding/referential depth currently; potentially high processing efficiency for specific tasks. | "Lens" defined by architecture/data/objectives; self-modeling for performance; goals usually externally set but can have emergent sub-goals; no biological self-awareness. | Varies greatly; can exhibit high task-specific autonomy; learns from data; rapid algorithmic/architectural evolution via human design & automated processes. | Primarily manipulates digital information; increasing capacity for direct physical influence via robotics/automation; potentially vast informational influence. | Can generate novel patterns/solutions within trained domains; potential for emergent creativity debated. Interacts with & built from human-generated info systems. |
| **"Informational System" (e.g., Ideology, Language)** | N/A directly; meaning is host-dependent. Complexity lies in its internal structure & rules (e.g., grammar). | N/A directly; "goals" are effective propagation/influence. | Evolves via variation, selection, transmission through hosts; cultural/memetic evolution. | Indirect influence by shaping host behavior, thereby organizing matter/energy (e.g., economies, cities). | Is a higher-order information system; novelty via mutation/recombination of ideas. |
