# 6. Mechanisms of Influence and Redrawing Borders in Collective Consciousness

## 6. a. Mechanisms of Influence on Reality:

### 6. a. 1. Traditional (Agent-Mediated):

Historically, information systems primarily shape physical reality by restructuring the cognitive states (beliefs, values, motivations, models of the world) of human agents. These altered internal states then lead to new patterns of individual and collective behavior, which in turn result in tangible material and social changes.

### 6. a. 2. Emerging (Direct AI-Mediated)

A significant new development is the rise of **AI systems** with agentic capabilities. These systems, as complex instantiations of information, can **directly manipulate matter and interact with the physical world** (e.g., automated manufacturing, robotics guided by computer vision LLMs) without the same degree of continuous human cognitive mediation. This represents a new, more direct pathway for information systems to exert causal influence.

## 6. b. Redrawing Borders in Collective Consciousness

The global flow of information, characteristic of the Information Age, can lead to a **"redrawing" of boundaries not only at the traditional national, cultural, or ideological levels but also at more subjective and conceptual levels, including the perceived demarcations of individual identity, the distinctions between conceptual categories, and the contours of social affiliations within the collective consciousness.** Observable indicators and consequences of this might include the rise of transnational identities and communities, the impact of globalized cultural products on local norms, increased polarization or new solidarities based on shared information rather than geography, and evolving challenges to notions of national sovereignty related to information control and cyber warfare.

The "fluid dynamics" metaphor offers a useful lens to understand these shifts. External informational "inflows," massively amplified by global networks, act as powerful new "currents" impinging upon and interacting with the existing internal "currents" of a group's or individual's established informational landscape (their dominant beliefs, narratives, and conceptual frameworks). This interaction is not passive; the inherent structure of reality as a "dynamic, inherently structured flow"—ultimately composed of interacting worldsheets—means these informational patterns are always in motion, influencing and being influenced.

When these external inflows meet internal currents, several outcomes can manifest:

- **Erosion of Existing Boundaries:** Strong or persistent external currents can wear down previously firm conceptual, cultural, or identity-based "borders." For example, prolonged exposure to global media can dilute local traditions or reshape individual self-perceptions by introducing alternative models of identity and success. The lines between "us" and "them," or between distinct conceptual categories, can become blurred or more permeable.
- **Creation of New "Confluences" and Hybrid Spaces:** Different informational streams can merge, creating novel "confluences" or hybrid informational spaces. An immigrant community, for instance, primarily consuming media, using language, and engaging with social networks from their country of origin (country A) while residing in a different geographical territory (country B), inhabits such a hybrid space. Their collective consciousness is shaped by the intermingling currents from both A and B, leading to unique cultural expressions, identity formations, and social dynamics that challenge traditional notions of singular cultural or informational sovereignty. This is not merely a blend but an emergent new pattern within the collective consciousness.
- **Reshaping of Identity and Awareness:** The constant interplay of these informational currents can fundamentally reshape both individual and collective identity and awareness. New solidarities may form based on shared information consumption rather than shared geography, while previously cohesive groups might experience internal fragmentation as members are pulled by diverging informational tides. The very categories through which agents perceive and make sense of the world (their "subjective distinctions" as per Section 2.a) can be transformed by these fluid informational dynamics.

This ongoing process highlights how "borders" in the collective consciousness are not static lines but dynamic, permeable interfaces constantly being negotiated and reshaped by the ever-flowing and interacting patterns of information, particularly accelerated in the current age.
