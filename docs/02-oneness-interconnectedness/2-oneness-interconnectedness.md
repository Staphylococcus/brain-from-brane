# **2. Oneness, Interconnectedness, and the Nature of Distinctions**

The universe is fundamentally a single, interconnected whole. This entirety can be conceptualized as a continuous, dynamic tapestry of interacting [**worldsheets**](../glossary.md#worldsheet). It's a single, interconnected whole because all **worldsheets** are part of the same spacetime continuum and can influence each other (consistent with fields and physical laws as emergent patterns of this flow).
