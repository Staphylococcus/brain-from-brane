## 2.1 Overview of Oneness
The universe is fundamentally a single, interconnected whole. This entirety can be conceptualized as a continuous, dynamic tapestry of interacting [**worldsheets**](../glossary.md#worldsheet).

## 2.2 Worldsheets and Interactions
All **worldsheets** exist within the same spacetime continuum and can influence each other through emergent field interactions, propagating effects across scales.

## 2.3 Reconciling Unity and Distinction
Even as these interactions maintain universal oneness, localized informational patterns give rise to emergent and subjective distinctions (see [2.a.](2a-emergent-subjective-distinctions.md) and [2.b.](2b-reconciling-oneness-and-competition.md)). This interplay underpins both harmonious coherence and dynamic differentiation within the fabric of reality.
