title: "Reconciling Oneness with Competition"
summary: >
  Shows how competitive dynamics among self-stabilizing patterns arise within a single interconnected substrate without contradicting fundamental unity.
description: >
  Links resource scarcity, outward stabilization propensity, and emergent competition to argue that striving patterns complement rather than violate the ontology of oneness.

The observed **competitive nature** of various systems (e.g., biological organisms, ideologies, languages) is an [**emergent dynamic**](../glossary/E.md#emergent-property) that occurs *within* this interconnected whole.

This competition is driven primarily by [**resource scarcity**](../glossary/R.md#resource-scarcity). For biological life, this includes material resources and energy. For information systems, key resources include **limited cognitive processing capacity in hosts**, the material substrates for their instantiation and transmission (e.g., brains, texts, digital networks, energy for computation), and more abstract factors contributing to their "memetic fitness" or "influence potential" in a crowded informational environment.

The "striving" of these patterns for persistence is not a teleological imposition but an outcome of the fundamental processes outlined in the [pathway of emergence (Section 1a)](../01-pattern-realism/1a-pathway-emergence/1a-pathway-emergence.md), including thermodynamic driving towards dissipative adaptation, the self-reinforcing nature of autocatalytic networks, and the boundary-maintaining imperatives of autopoietic organization. These mechanisms provide a physical and organizational basis for the [Outward Stabilization Propensity](../glossary/O.md#outward-stabilization-propensity) of patterns.

Thus, competition does not necessarily contradict fundamental oneness but is a characteristic of how distinct patterns interact and strive for persistence at emergent levels under conditions of limitation. The patterns that outcompete other patterns are the ones that end up persisting.
