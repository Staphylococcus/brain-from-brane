# **2.b. Reconciling Oneness with Competition**

The observed **competitive nature** of various systems (e.g., biological organisms, ideologies, languages) is an [**emergent dynamic**](../glossary.md#emergent-property) that occurs *within* this interconnected whole.

This competition is driven primarily by [**resource scarcity**](../glossary.md#resource-scarcity). For biological life, this includes material resources and energy. For information systems, key resources include **limited cognitive processing capacity in hosts**, the material substrates for their instantiation and transmission (e.g., brains, texts, digital networks, energy for computation), and more abstract factors contributing to their "memetic fitness" or "influence potential" in a crowded informational environment.

Thus, competition does not necessarily contradict fundamental oneness but is a characteristic of how distinct patterns interact and strive for persistence at emergent levels under conditions of limitation.
