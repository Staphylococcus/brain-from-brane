# 3.b. Broader Agency and Reciprocal Dynamics

This capacity for [information](../glossary.md#information) processing and environmental interaction is not exclusive to humans. Other biological [agents](../glossary.md#agent) also process [information](../glossary.md#information) and shape their reality, leading to **reciprocal feedback loops and co-evolutionary dynamics** between different agentive systems. These interactions can be incredibly deep, fostering forms of co-[evolution](../glossary.md#evolution) where the persistence and [evolution](../glossary.md#evolution) of one system become critically dependent on the functions and resources provided by another, and vice-versa, creating a tightly woven fabric of existence. This is particularly evident in the intricate relationship between biological [agents](../glossary.md#agent) and the complex [information systems](../glossary.md#information-system) they host, generate, and propagateâ€”a dynamic that will be explored in greater detail when examining the [evolution](../glossary.md#evolution) of [information systems](../glossary.md#information-system) themselves (see [Section 4](../04-information-systems/4-information-systems.md)). The spectrum of complexity among these non-human biological [agents](../glossary.md#agent) is vast, reflecting diverse evolutionary paths and adaptations. Applying the refined complexity criteria, we can create a comparative table:

**Complexity Spectrum in Non-Human Biological Agents**

| Example Agent | ["Inside-Out Lens"](../glossary.md#inside-out-lens) & [Semantic Capabilities](../glossary.md#semantic-information) | Goal Complexity, Autonomy, & Learning/Adaptation | Novelty & Interaction with Info Systems |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Amoeba** | Rudimentary lens; direct functional meaning ([Proto-Semantics](../glossary.md#proto-semantics), Stage III) for immediate survival cues (light, chemical gradients). | Simple goals (nutrients, harm avoidance, division); low, reactive autonomy; adaptation primarily genetic. | Novelty mainly via genetic mutation; no interaction with complex info systems. |
| **Insects (e.g., Bees)** | More developed lens; understands complex spatial info for navigation; interprets waggle dance as symbolic (Developing Semantics, Stage IV); integrates learned associations with innate behaviors. | More complex, largely instinctual goals (colony survival: foraging, hive maintenance); moderate autonomy (choosing foraging patches); associative learning. | Limited behavioral novelty (can adapt foraging to new flowers); interacts via innate responses to cues & structured communication (waggle dance). |
| **Birds (e.g., Corvids/Crows)** | Significantly more sophisticated lens; advanced problem-solving, tool use/modification; recognizes individual human faces; understands basic physics (water displacement); complex social cues; rich internal environmental model; possible rudimentary theory of mind. | Complex, flexible goal-directed behavior (food caching, multi-step puzzles, teaching offspring); considerable autonomy; learns extensively via individual experience, observation, potential social learning; notable adaptability to human environments. | Renowned for innovative problem-solving & behavioral flexibility (e.g., New Caledonian crows manufacturing/designing tools); interacts with complex environmental [information](../glossary.md#information) & simple signaling systems. |
| **Mammals (e.g., Dolphins, Great Apes/Chimpanzees)** | Highly complex ["inside-out lenses";](../glossary.md#inside-out-lens) many exhibit self-recognition (marker for [self-awareness](../glossary.md#self-awareness)); advanced [semantic capabilities](../glossary.md#semantic-information) (complex vocalizations, gestures, facial expressions); specific calls for predators/food (chimps); profound understanding of social dynamics (alliances, hierarchies, deception); some captive apes learn hundreds of symbols (symbolic representation capacity); significant foresight, planning, complex social memory. | Highly complex, often socially mediated goals (political alliances, status competition, long-term young care, cooperative hunting); high autonomy (decisions based on intricate social knowledge/past experiences); multifaceted learning (extensive observational social learning, imitation, active teaching); cultural transmission of behaviors (tool-use techniques). | High capacity for novelty (diverse/region-specific tool use, innovative hunting, complex social maneuvers); engage with sophisticated social signaling systems; can learn/use human-devised symbolic systems to a degree; do not naturally create [higher-order symbolic info systems](../glossary.md#higher-order-information-system) like human language. |

These examples illustrate that while no non-human animal reaches the level of ["full-blown semantics"](../glossary.md#full-blown-semantics) or the complexity of human-generated [higher-order information systems,](../glossary.md#higher-order-information-system) many possess sophisticated ["inside-out lenses"](../glossary.md#inside-out-lens) and demonstrate significant capabilities in [semantic processing,](../glossary.md#semantic-information) goal complexity, autonomy, learning, and novelty. Their agency results in reciprocal dynamics with their environments and other [agents](../glossary.md#agent), including humans (e.g., urban wildlife adapting to cities, pets co-evolving social signals with humans). Understanding this spectrum is crucial for appreciating the diverse ways [information](../glossary.md#information) is processed and acted upon in the biological world.
