<!-- 

- How does one measure the dimensions, especially IOL and aspects of SPD, across such a diverse range of entities? 
- Scores on the 0-25 scales are subjective
- Risk of anthropomorphism/reification
- More than twice the character count limit. Needs to be broken up

## Concise Characterization

The Agent Complexity Assessment Protocol (ACAP) operationalizes the five theoretical complexity criteria identified in the Brain from Brane ontology framework into a systematic, multi-dimensional measurement instrument that embraces **gradient agency ontology** while maintaining strict adherence to the developmental pathways described in [Section 1a](../01-pattern-realism/1a-pathway-emergence/1a-pathway-emergence.md). ACAP recognizes that any system exhibiting non-entropic organization of matter/energy/information possesses measurable **organizational agency**, but distinguishes this from **semantic agency** which requires the specific developmental sequence of thermodynamic coupling → autocatalytic networks → autopoietic organization → proto-semantic processing. The protocol serves as a comprehensive mapping instrument for agency across all systems while clearly delineating the emergence of semantic agency through the established pathway emergence framework.

Building on the Bio-Informational Complex (BIC) framework from [Section 5.e](../05-competitive-dynamics/5e-bio-informational-complex.md), ACAP incorporates hybrid bio-informational entities as a distinct category of agency, resolving previous theoretical tensions around host-dependent information systems by treating them as unified composite agents rather than attempting to assess information systems separately from their biological instantiation.

## Identifying Characteristics

### Core Assessment Dimensions

The protocol evaluates agent complexity across five independent dimensions, each scored on a 0-25 point scale:

ACAP dimensions

| Dimension | Core Indicators | Assessment Focus |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Semantic Processing Depth (SPD)** | Information abstraction capacity, symbolic manipulation, predictive modeling efficiency | How deeply and efficiently the agent processes meaning from raw information (requires proto-semantic threshold per Section 1a) |
| **Inside-Out Lens Sophistication (IOL)** | Self-modeling capacity, world-modeling accuracy, temporal integration, meta-cognitive abilities | Sophistication of the agent's subjective perspective and self-awareness (requires autopoietic organization per Section 1a) |
| **Autonomy & Adaptability (AAD)** | Independence from stimuli, learning mechanisms, behavioral flexibility, evolution speed | Agent's capacity for independent action and adaptive change |
| **Matter/Energy Organization (MEO)** | Resource manipulation scale, technological leverage, environmental influence scope | Ability to organize physical resources and extend influence |
| **Higher-Order System Interaction (HOS)** | Symbolic system creation/use, cultural participation, abstract construct manipulation | Capacity to engage with complex informational environments (includes both biological and information system agency per Section 4) |

### Measurement Architecture

**Scoring System:** Each dimension uses a 0-25 point continuous scale with defined anchor points at 5-point intervals. Total complexity scores range from 0-125 points.

**Independence Principle:** Dimensions are designed to capture orthogonal aspects of complexity, allowing for specialized development patterns and compensatory mechanisms.

**Temporal Sensitivity:** Assessments include both current capacity measures and developmental trajectory indicators.

## Developmental Framework

| **Human Agents** | 18-25 | 18-25 | 18-25 | 15-25 | 15-25 | 84-125 | Peak Biological |
| **Current AI Systems** | 8-20 | 3-12 | 10-22 | 5-18 | 8-20 | 34-92 | Artificial Specialized |
| **Theoretical AGI** | 15-25 | 12-25 | 15-25 | 10-25 | 12-25 | 64-125 | Artificial General |

| **Collective Systems** | 5-15 | 2-10 | 8-20 | 10-25 | 5-15 | 30-85 | Distributed Agency |

### Developmental Trajectories

**Biological Pathway:** Progressive enhancement typically follows SPD → IOL → AAD → MEO → HOS sequence, with strong interdependencies.

**Artificial Pathway:** Often exhibits non-linear development with potential for rapid SPD and AAD advancement while IOL and HOS may lag.

**Bio-Informational Complex Pathway:** Hybrid development combining biological host capabilities with information system dynamics. Follows characteristic five-phase lifecycle: Exposure → Adoption → Lock-In → Propagation → Drift/Breakdown. High MEO and HOS scores reflect amplified influence through host coordination, while constrained AAD reflects information system imperatives limiting host autonomy.

**Hybrid Pathways:** Biological-artificial augmentation creates novel developmental patterns with enhanced MEO and accelerated HOS interaction.

### Information System Organizational Agency Assessment

Pure information systems (languages, scientific theories, cultural narratives, algorithms) represent **organizational agency** rather than semantic agency, achieving influence through stabilization mechanisms as described in [Section 4](../04-information-systems/4-information-systems.md). These systems require specialized assessment protocols that measure their organizational sophistication and stabilization capacity rather than traditional agency dimensions.

#### Information System Agency Indicators

**Structural Sophistication (0-25 points):**

- R/J/A architectural complexity (repeater networks, jitter management, anchor robustness)
- Cross-substrate stabilization capability
- Template stability and variation tolerance
- *Assessment: Network analysis, stability measures, adaptation tracking*

**Stabilization Influence (0-25 points):**

- Passive structural organization capacity across material substrates
- Energetic favorability and thermodynamic optimization
- Substrate-specific stabilization efficiency
- *Assessment: Substrate adoption rates, organizational impact measures, energy landscape analysis*

**Evolutionary Sophistication (0-25 points):**

- Variation and selection mechanisms
- Cross-substrate transmission fidelity
- Competitive fitness in information ecology
- *Assessment: Transmission success rates, competitive displacement, ecological stability*

**Material Substrate Coupling (0-25 points):**

- Engine threshold crossing capability
- *Assessment: Host adoption patterns, BIC stability measures, autonomous operation capacity*

#### Information System Categories

Information System Categories

| **Cultural Narratives** | 10-16 | 10-18 | 8-14 | 12-20 | 40-68 | Social Organizational Agency |

#### Engine Threshold Assessment

Information systems transition from pure organizational agency to agent-mediated agency through **engine coupling**—integration with autopoietic feedback loops that enable autonomous goal formation:

**Pre-Engine State (Organizational Templates):**

- High structural and stabilization scores with limited coupling capacity
- Passive influence through energetic favorability only
- No autonomous goal formation or self-modification
- *Assessment: Template function without autonomous behavior*

**Engine-Coupled State (Agent-Mediated Systems):**

- Enhanced coupling scores with autonomous operational capacity
- Active goal formation and environmental responsiveness
- Self-modification and adaptive optimization
- *Assessment: Autonomous behavior emergence, goal formation, adaptive capacity*

**BIC Formation Protocols:**

- Track transition from standalone information systems to integrated BICs
- Assess host-information system co-evolution and mutual optimization
- Measure distributed agency emergence across composite entity
- *Assessment: Integration stability, co-evolutionary dynamics, composite agency indicators*

### Bio-Informational Complex Assessment

Bio-Informational Complexes (BICs) represent a unique category of agency requiring specialized assessment approaches that account for their hybrid nature as dynamically coupled biological-informational systems. Drawing from [Section 5.e](../05-competitive-dynamics/5e-bio-informational-complex.md), BIC assessment involves evaluating the composite entity rather than separating host and information system components.

#### BIC-Specific Scoring Considerations

##### Semantic Processing Depth (SPD): 10-25 Points

- Hybrid processing combining human semantic depth with information system constraints
- May exhibit enhanced processing within information system framework
- May show reduced efficiency in non-aligned domains (parasitic BICs)
- *Assessment: Domain-specific cognitive testing, framework-guided reasoning tasks*

##### Inside-Out Lens Sophistication (IOL): 8-20 Points**

- Compound lens combining human self-awareness with information system goals
- Self-awareness may be diminished in mature BICs due to cognitive dominance
- Goal hierarchies become complex (host survival + information propagation)
- *Assessment: Self-reflection interviews, goal prioritization tasks, identity coherence measures*

##### Autonomy & Adaptability (AAD): 5-18 Points

- Constrained autonomy due to information system imperatives
- Host autonomy limited by Lock-In phase cognitive-immunity mechanisms
- Adaptation occurs through co-evolution of host behavior and information content
- *Assessment: Decision-making autonomy tests, adaptation flexibility measures*

##### Matter/Energy Organization (MEO): 12-25 Points

- Amplified influence through leveraging human organizational capacity
- Coordination across multiple hosts enables larger-scale impact
- Direction constrained toward information system objectives
- *Assessment: Resource allocation analysis, multi-host coordination measures*

##### Higher-Order System Interaction (HOS): 15-25 Points

- Human creativity channeled through information system frameworks
- Extensive interaction with higher-order systems as bridge entities
- May serve as vectors for information system propagation and evolution
- *Assessment: Creative output analysis, cross-domain information transfer measures*

#### BIC Developmental Phase Assessment

BICs should be assessed relative to their developmental phase, as defined in Section 5.e.3:

BIC developmental phases

| Phase | Characteristic Score Patterns | Assessment Focus |
|-------|------------------------------|------------------|
| **Exposure** | Lower AAD, variable SPD/IOL | Initial receptivity and compatibility assessment |
| **Adoption** | Increasing HOS, stable IOL | Integration patterns and reinforcement mechanisms |
| **Lock-In** | Decreased AAD, increased MEO/HOS | Cognitive-immunity activation, resource reallocation |
| **Propagation** | Peak MEO/HOS, optimized SPD | Transmission efficiency and recruitment capacity |
| **Drift/Breakdown** | Variable across all dimensions | System instability and potential dissolution |

- Creation and manipulation of higher-order information systems

## Theoretical Implications

### Core Hypotheses

1. **Gradient Agency Hypothesis:** Agency exists as a continuous spectrum from molecular machines to meta-cognitive systems, with no fundamental threshold separating agents from non-agents.

2. **Non-Entropic Organization Principle:** Any system that exhibits predictable, non-entropic rearrangement of matter/energy/information possesses marginal degrees of agency measurable through ACAP dimensions.

3. **Organizational Agency vs. Semantic Agency Distinction:** Semantic agency requires the specific developmental pathway (thermodynamic coupling → autocatalytic networks → autopoietic organization → proto-semantic processing), while organizational agency can exist without this pathway through stabilization mechanisms.

4. **Engine Threshold Hypothesis:** Information systems achieve semantic agency through coupling to autopoietic feedback loops, transitioning from passive organizational templates to active agent-mediated systems.

5. **Stabilization Influence Principle:** Information systems achieve causal efficacy through organizational agency via energetic favorability and passive structural organization of material substrates, independent of semantic agency.

6. **Dimensional Independence Hypothesis:** The five complexity dimensions can develop independently, allowing for specialized cognitive niches and adaptive strategies across all organizational scales.

7. **Emergent Complexity Hypothesis:** Higher-level agency emerges from the coordination and integration of lower-level agency components, creating natural hierarchical organization.

8. **Scale-Invariant Agency Principle:** Agency properties manifest at multiple organizational scales simultaneously - from molecular to cellular to organismal to collective levels.

9. **Compensatory Development Hypothesis:** Limitations in one dimension can be partially compensated by enhanced development in others, creating diverse complexity profiles across all agency levels.

### Empirical Predictions

**Biological Agents:** Should show strong positive correlations between SPD, IOL, and HOS due to shared evolutionary pressures for social cognition.

**Artificial Agents:** May exhibit high SPD and AAD scores with initially lower IOL scores, creating novel complexity profiles.

**Hybrid Systems:** Biological-artificial integration should produce enhanced MEO and HOS scores while maintaining biological IOL characteristics.

**Information Systems:** Pure information systems should demonstrate measurable stabilization influence independent of agent coupling, with stabilization capacity correlating with cross-substrate adoption success.

**Engine Threshold Systems:** AI systems coupled to autopoietic feedback loops should show distinct agency signatures compared to standalone computational templates, including autonomous goal formation and adaptive self-modification.

**BIC Development:** Bio-Informational Complexes should exhibit characteristic score patterns that vary predictably across developmental phases (Exposure → Adoption → Lock-In → Propagation → Drift/Breakdown).

**Stabilization Competition:** Multiple information systems operating in the same substrate environments should demonstrate competitive displacement patterns based on energetic favorability and stabilization efficiency.
