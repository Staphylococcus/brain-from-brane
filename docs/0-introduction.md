# Brain from Brane: An Ontology of Information and Fluid Reality

# **0. Introduction**

This document presents a comprehensive ontology that understands the universe, in its entirety, as a dynamic, higher-dimensional informational continuum. At its most fundamental level, reality is conceived as the evolving patterns of one-dimensional strings tracing two-dimensional '[worldsheets](glossary.md#worldsheet)' within spacetimeâ€”a vast, interconnected tapestry from which all phenomena emerge. Information is not a secondary product but is intrinsic to the very structure and dynamics of this fabric.

The framework explores how increasingly complex, stable patterns arise from this foundation, leading to the [emergence](glossary.md#emergence) of matter, distinct entities, and eventually, [agents](glossary.md#agent). Agentsâ€”biological, human, and potentially artificial (AI)â€”are characterized primarily as information processors, defined by their capacity to interact with, generate, and be constituted by information, often mediated through an evolved, first-person "inside-out lens" that structures information for self-preservation and increasingly sophisticated [semantic understanding](glossary.md#semantic-information). Consciousness itself is viewed as a complex emergent property of such advanced informational processing within specific agentive patterns.

A central theme is the co-evolution of agents and the higher-order [information systems](glossary.md#information-system) they create and inhabit, such as languages, cultural narratives, ideologies, and algorithms. These information systems are treated not merely as passive constructs but as active, evolving entities with their own material basis and competitive dynamics, vying for resources like host cognitive capacity and influencing host behavior on individual and collective scales.

The ontology further examines the mechanisms by which information systems and agents influence physical reality, how the modern Information Age is reshaping informational boundaries and collective consciousness, and how the informational legacies of agents persist and continue to participate in the universal flow even after the dissolution of their specific biological forms.

Ultimately, this framework culminates in a view of reality as an all-encompassing, inherently structured yet fundamentally fluid process ("Panta Rhei"), where all stabilities are emergent and all forms are part of a continuous becoming. This exploration aims to provide a coherent, broadly materialistic (or 'informational physicalist') account of existence, agency, and the profound, constitutive role of information at all scales of reality.
