# Pattern Realism: Matter/Energy and Information as Complementary Lenses

The universe, in its entirety, is an indivisible **higher-dimensional continuum** (spacetime, perhaps with compactified dimensions as envisaged by string theory) in which fundamental **one-dimensional strings** sweep out **two-dimensional “worldsheets.”** This ceaseless weave of worldsheets—from the quantum to the cosmic scale—*is* the fabric of reality. 

Throughout this document we will examine that fabric through two mutually-entailing descriptive lenses:

- the **matter/energy lens**, which tracks conserved quantities, forces, and dynamical evolution; and
- the **information lens**, which tracks the distinguishability of states, pattern-structure, and the flow of “difference that makes a difference.”

Nothing ontological separates these views; they are bookkeeping schemes applied to the same underlying pattern. When the prose privileges informational vocabulary, it should be read as a perspectival choice, not as a claim that “information floats free of matter.”

## Nature of Information – Fundamental and Organizational

From the information perspective, the dynamic worldsheets can be treated as **structured signals**—persistent differences that can, in principle, be copied, transformed, or lost. From the matter/energy perspective those same worldsheets are **vibrational excitations** carrying momentum, charge, and so on. The descriptive shift changes the questions we ask (about entropy versus about forces) but not the underlying stuff. For brevity, the remainder of Section 1 adopts the informational viewpoint, with the tacit understanding that every statement has a dual reading in conventional physical terms.

Within this informational lens, information is not a secondary add-on but co-fundamental with the physical description; it is simply the same pattern read under a state-counting metric. Visualizing **one-dimensional strings sweeping out two-dimensional worldsheets** offers an intuitive picture of how such structured signals arise.

- It encompasses the **intrinsic properties** of these **fundamental strings**. Crucially, their specific, **stable, and quantized modes of vibration** determine their apparent characteristics (like mass, charge, and spin). Each such stable vibrational mode manifests as a **distinct type of elementary particle**, forming the first layer of **stable building blocks** from which more complex structures emerge. These particle properties, born from specific vibrational patterns, in turn define the nature of the strings' **worldsheets** and their subsequent interactions.
- It is embodied in the **specific configurations and histories (the worldsheets)** of these **strings** through spacetime – their dynamic form, interactions (such as joining and splitting), and relational configurations.
- It manifests as the **broader emergent patterns and structures** that arise from the collective tapestry of these interwoven **worldsheets** when observed at different scales.

Thus, there is an **inseparable link between the strings and the informational patterns they realise**. A **string** *is* its dynamic pattern of existence; describing that pattern in energy units or in bits are alternate projections of the same object. Ontologically, we therefore lean toward what philosophers call **ontic structural realism**: reality is structured process; “material” and “informational” are two coherent but partial glosses on that structure.

The transition from basic organisational/structural pattern (e.g., the patterns of worldsheets underlying an atom) to *semantic* or *processed* information is therefore not a jump from “matter” to “information,” but a climb up the same pattern hierarchy toward configurations that model, predict, and act upon other configurations.
