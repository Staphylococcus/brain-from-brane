## **A**

### Adaptation
The process by which agents or information systems modify their structure or behavior in response to environmental changes, enabling improved survival, persistence, or propagation within their operational context.

### Agency
The capacity for systems to exhibit goal-directed behavior, environmental responsiveness, and autonomous organization of matter/energy/information patterns. Agency exists on a continuous spectrum from simple molecular selectivity to sophisticated self-reflective behavior, encompassing both [organizational agency](#organizational-agency) (structural influence through energetic favorability and pattern stabilization) and [semantic agency](#semantic-agency) (meaning-making through autopoietic self-organization). The Brain from Brane framework recognizes agency as a fundamental property of organized systems, measurable through [ACAP](#agent-complexity-assessment-protocol-acap) protocols across all scales of reality.

### Agent
A system capable of recursive process optimization, goal pursuit, and environmental responsiveness as measured through [ACAP](#agent-complexity-assessment-protocol-acap) dimensional analysis. Agents exist on a complexity spectrum from simple reactive systems to sophisticated [Bio-Informational Complexes](#bio-informational-complex-bic) with full semantic agency capabilities.

### Agent Complexity Assessment Protocol (ACAP)
A five-dimensional measurement framework for systematically assessing agent capabilities: (1) Adaptive Response Sophistication, (2) Goal Hierarchy Complexity, (3) Environmental Model Depth, (4) Self-Reflection Capacity, and (5) Behavioral Autonomy. ACAP provides objective criteria for distinguishing simple reactive systems from sophisticated agents with semantic agency.

### Agent-Relative
Information or meaning that exists only in relation to a specific agent's perspective, capabilities, and organizational needs, rather than having objective existence independent of interpreting agents.

### Algorithmic Organizational Templates
Computational information systems that function as [organizational information](#organizational-information) patterns to structure digital information environments and mediate interactions between information systems and hosts. These templates, exemplified by social media algorithms and search engines, achieve influence through automated [compatibility matching](#compatibility-matching) and preference optimization rather than semantic meaning-making. They represent a novel form of [organizational agency](#organizational-agency) operating through technological infrastructure to create personalized information landscapes that shape host behavior and attention patterns.

### Algorithms
Computational procedures or rule-based systems that process information through systematic operations, representing organizational templates that guide mechanical execution with precise repetition and controlled variation.

### Artificial Intelligence
Computational systems designed to simulate or replicate aspects of intelligent behavior, representing a form of agent that processes information through algorithmic rather than biological substrates.

### Autocatalytic
Self-reinforcing processes where the products of a reaction catalyze the same reaction, creating positive feedback loops that accelerate development and enable autonomous organization and growth.

### Autopoietic
Self-producing and self-maintaining organizational systems that actively maintain their identity through continuous regeneration of their components while preserving their essential organizational structure.

---

## **B**

### Behavioral Feedback Loops
Dynamic interaction patterns where host actions provide data that enables information systems to modify their structural compatibility and optimize their influence. Behavioral feedback loops exemplify how [algorithmic organizational templates](#algorithmic-organizational-templates) create personalized environments by using host behavior to refine content delivery, interface design, and interaction patterns. These loops operate primarily through [organizational agency](#organizational-agency) rather than semantic processing, creating emergent information landscapes that influence collective behavior patterns.

### Bio-Informational Complex (BIC)
A stable relationship between biological agents and structurally-stabilized information systems characterized by mutual benefit, identity integration, and co-evolutionary development. BICs develop through a five-phase sequence: Exposure → Adoption → Lock-In → Propagation → Drift/Breakdown, representing a new category of agency emerging from human-information system coupling.

---

## **C**

### Collective Consciousness
The shared information processing and meaning-making capabilities that emerge when multiple agents coordinate their cognitive activities through cultural transmission and social interaction mechanisms.

### Compatibility Matching
The process by which information systems achieve adoption and persistence through structural alignment with host capabilities, cognitive architecture, social context, and resource constraints. Compatibility matching represents a key mechanism of [organizational agency](#organizational-agency), where systems succeed not through persuasion but by providing more efficient pathways for accomplishing tasks or meeting needs. Educational curricula that match students' developmental capacities and software interfaces that align with user expectations exemplify compatibility matching dynamics.

### Competitive Dynamics
The processes by which different information systems, agents, or organizational patterns compete for resources, substrates, and influence within shared environments, driving evolutionary development and structural optimization.

### Consciousness

---

## **O**

### Organizational Agency
The capacity for systems to guide behavior and organize material substrates through structural influence, efficiency advantages, and energetic favorability rather than through meaning-making or intentional persuasion. Any system exhibiting non-entropic organization of matter/energy/information possesses measurable organizational agency, which operates through stabilization mechanisms and template effects. Organizational agency is distinguished from [semantic agency](#semantic-agency), which requires the specific developmental sequence of thermodynamic coupling → autocatalytic networks → autopoietic organization → proto-semantic processing.

### Organizational Information
Intermediate-level information patterns that structure the arrangement and interaction of material components, representing crystallized organizational templates that coordinate complex system behavior.

### Outward Stabilization Propensity
**A fundamental principle where self-stabilizing patterns extend their organizational influence to their surrounding environment.** This process operates through **structural constraint propagation**, where a pattern imposes its inherent structure onto a receptive substrate. It is not merely passive resistance but an active extension of order that functions through mechanisms like boundary stabilization, [template effects](#template-effects), and structural recruitment. This propensity drives both information system expansion and agent-environment coupling.

---

## **P**

### Parasitic Frameworks
Information systems that achieve persistence and propagation by exploiting the resources and organizational structures of host systems without providing reciprocal benefits.

### Pattern Realism
The ontological framework establishing that reality consists of a single structured process (composed of interplay of worldsheets within a high-dimensional spacetime) where matter/energy and information represent complementary descriptions of the same fundamental patterns. Pattern Realism provides the metaphysical foundation for **Structural Information Dynamics** by justifying information stabilization as an organizational process operating in a higher-dimensional space.

### Pathway Emergence
The process through which new organizational patterns develop from thermodynamic coupling through autopoietic organization to semantic agency. Pathway emergence explains how information systems achieve increasing sophistication and autonomy through coupling dynamics and **structural template optimization**.

### Proto-Semantics
Early-stage meaning-making capabilities characterized by functional significance assignment and basic environmental interpretation, representing the developmental stage between simple detection and full semantic processing.

### Structural Resonance
The alignment and compatibility between an information system's organizational patterns and existing environmental structures, cultural frameworks, or host capabilities. Structural resonance determines whether information systems can gain widespread adoption within specific contexts. Scientific methodologies achieved structural resonance in Western cultural contexts through compatibility with existing emphases on systematic observation and logical reasoning, while facing adoption barriers in contexts with incompatible epistemological frameworks.

### Template Effects
The mechanism by which self-stabilizing patterns serve as organizational templates that guide the formation of similar or complementary patterns in their surrounding environment. Template effects represent one of the primary ways that stable information patterns extend their influence through the [outward stabilization propensity](#outward-stabilization-propensity). Examples include language grammars structuring communication patterns, software interfaces guiding user behavior, and cultural practices shaping social organization. Template effects operate through **structural influence** rather than semantic persuasion, making them a key component of [organizational agency](#organizational-agency).

- **Jitter**: Variation sources that enable **controlled structural defect introduction** for adaptive evolution
- **Anchors**: Stability mechanisms that maintain **structural integrity** while allowing adaptive modification

### Resource Scarcity
Conditions where essential resources (energy, materials, information, or substrate access) are limited relative to competitive demand, driving competitive dynamics and selective pressures.

---

## **S**

### Self-Awareness
The capacity for agents to maintain and utilize models of themselves as bounded entities with properties, capabilities, and limitations, enabling sophisticated self-referential processing and behavior guidance.

### Self-Stabilizing Patterns
Information patterns that actively maintain their organizational integrity through environmental interaction, demonstrating robustness against perturbation and capability for structural preservation across time and substrate transitions.

### Semantic Agency
The capacity for goal-directed behavior based on meaning interpretation and environmental modeling, distinguished from simple reactive responses through **ACAP assessment protocols**. Semantic agency emerges when information systems cross the [Engine Threshold](#engine-threshold) and achieve autonomous operation through **structural template optimization** and environmental manipulation capabilities.

### Semantic Information
Agent-relative interpretations and meaning-assignments that emerge when organizational patterns interact with information-processing agents, representing the highest level of the information hierarchy and enabling cultural transmission and abstract reasoning.

### Semantic vs. Organizational vs. Fundamental
The three-level hierarchy of information patterns within the Brain from Brane framework:

- **[Fundamental Information](#fundamental-information)**: Basic quantum and physical patterns that constitute the foundation of reality
- **[Organizational Information](#organizational-information)**: Intermediate patterns that structure material arrangements and processes  
- **[Semantic Information](#semantic-information)**: Agent-interpreted meanings that emerge from organizational patterns through cognitive processing

This hierarchy represents increasing levels of complexity and agency-dependence, with each level building upon the previous while exhibiting distinct properties and causal capabilities.

### Social Norms

### Worldsheet
A two-dimensional surface swept out by a one-dimensional string as it travels through spacetime. The collective tapestry of all worldsheets constitutes the fundamental fabric of reality, a structured process where matter/energy and information are complementary descriptions of the same underlying patterns.

The worldsheet framework justifies treating information stabilization as a literal organizational process rather than a metaphorical description, providing the ontological foundation for **measurable structural properties** of information systems.
