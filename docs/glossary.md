# Glossary

A collection of key terms and definitions used throughout this project.

## Agent <a name="agent"></a>
An entity (biological, computational, or conceptual) that senses, processes, and acts upon information in order to achieve goals or maintain states.

## Agent-relative <a name="agent-relative"></a>
Dependent on the perspective, capabilities, or context of a specific agent.

## Adaptation <a name="adaptation"></a>
In biology, a trait with a current functional role in the life of an organism that is maintained and evolved by means of natural selection. More broadly, the process by which an agent or system becomes better suited to its environment or context.

## Algorithms
A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

## Bio-Informational Complex <a name="bio-informational-complex"></a>
A tightly integrated unit where biological hosts and information systems function as quasi-organismic wholes that co-evolve and protect their informational patterns (see [5e-bio-informational-complex](05-competitive-dynamics/5e-bio-informational-complex.md)).

## Cognitive Biases
Systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. They are often studied in psychology, sociology and behavioral economics.

## Cognitive Frameworks
Mental structures or models that individuals use to organize and interpret information from their environment. These frameworks shape perception, understanding, and decision-making.

## Cognitive Load
The total amount of mental effort being used in the working memory. Cognitive load theory differentiates cognitive load into three types: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.

## Collective Consciousness
The set of shared beliefs, ideas, attitudes, and knowledge that are common to a social group or society. It operates as a unifying force within society.

## Competitive Dynamics
Interactions among agents or information systems driven by limited resources, selection pressures, and adaptive strategies.

## Consciousness
A complex emergent property, particularly involving self-awareness and subjective experience (qualia), arising from advanced informational processing within certain agents. Its precise ontological nature and the mechanisms of its emergence from non-experiential physical patterns remain a subject of profound inquiry.

## Cultural Evolution
A form of [evolution](#evolution) applied to cultural elements (e.g., beliefs, practices, technologies), describing their change over time, often through processes such as variation, selection, and [cultural transmission](#cultural-transmission).

## Cultural Memetics
The study of cultural information and its transmission from an evolutionary perspective, often using analogies to genetics (memes as units of cultural information).

## Cultural Narratives
Stories, myths, and accounts shared within a culture that explain its origins, values, and purpose. They shape collective identity and understanding of the world.

## Cultural Transmission
The process by which cultural elements (e.g., information, behaviors, customs, values) are passed from one individual to another or from one generation to the next, through learning or imitation.

## Emergence
The process by which novel, higher-level properties or behaviors arise from the interactions and organization of lower-level components.

## Evolution <a name="evolution"></a>
The process of change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. More broadly, any process of gradual development and change in systems (e.g., cultural evolution, algorithmic evolution).

## Feedback Loops
Circular processes in which the output of a system is fed back into the system as input, influencing its subsequent behavior. Feedback can be positive (amplifying change) or negative (stabilizing the system).

## Foundational Patterns and Propensities
Inherent structures, tendencies, or biases within reality that arise directly from fundamental physics (e.g., quantization, string interaction rules, spacetime geometry). These patterns exist prior to and independently of complex agency, providing a textured landscape upon which emergent phenomena, including agent-relative distinctions, can form.

## Fundamental Information
The raw informational content underlying physical phenomena, often viewed as the lowest-level bits or qubits that constitute matter and energy.

## Hard Problem of Consciousness <a name="hard-problem-of-consciousness"></a>
The puzzle of why and how physical processes in certain agents give rise to subjective qualitative experiences (qualia). See [1c-hard-problem-of-consciousness](01-pattern-realism/1c-hard-problem-of-consciousness.md).

## Higher-Order Information Systems
Complex, abstract informational constructs whose primary existence and function are in the realm of information, though they may require physical instantiation (e.g., language, mathematics, software, culture, scientific theories, ideologies, and legal systems). These systems emerge from and influence the interactions of agents.

## Ideologies
Comprehensive and coherent sets of beliefs, values, and ideas that provide a framework for understanding the world and guiding social or political action.

## Information
Data that has been processed, organized, or structured in a way that imparts meaning or knowledge. Within this framework, it can be understood at multiple levels: fundamental (raw physical states), organizational (patterns and structures), and semantic (meaning for an agent).

## Information System
A network or collection of agents, processes, and structures that collect, store, transform, and disseminate information.

## Informational Continuum <a name="informational-continuum"></a>
A dynamic, higher-dimensional informational substrate hypothesized as the fundamental fabric of reality, where informational patterns underpin physical structures and cognitive processes.

## Inside-Out Lens <a name="inside-out-lens"></a>
A metaphor for the agent-specific, first-person perspective that structures information in a functionally adaptive way for survival and goal-directed behavior.

## Natural Selection
The process whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. It is a key mechanism of biological evolution.

## Organizational Information
Patterns and structures formed by fundamental information that give rise to complexity and functional organization in systems.

## Pattern Realism
A philosophical perspective that treats matter/energy and information as complementary patterns for understanding the universe. It emphasizes that both physical and informational descriptions are valid lenses on reality.

## Qualia
The subjective, qualitative properties of experience; the "what it is like" aspect of consciousness (e.g., the redness of red, the painfulness of pain).

## Resource Scarcity
A condition where the demand for a resource (material, energetic, cognitive, etc.) exceeds its availability. This scarcity is a primary driver of [competitive dynamics](#competitive-dynamics), as agents or systems vie for these limited resources necessary for their survival, function, or propagation.

## Self-Awareness
A state of consciousness in which an agent recognizes itself as a distinct entity, separate from other entities and the environment, often involving introspection and a concept of self.

## Semantic Information
Informational content that carries meaning or purpose for an agent, arising from organizational information and its interpretive context.

## Semantic vs. Organizational vs. Fundamental
A hierarchy of information types:
- Fundamental: raw bits/qubits
- Organizational: structured patterns
- Semantic: interpreted meaning

## Social Norms
Shared standards of acceptable behavior by groups. Social norms can both be informal understandings that govern the behavior of members of a society, as well as be codified into rules and laws.

## Technological Advancements
The development and application of new tools, techniques, systems, or methods of organization, often leading to significant changes in how information is processed, societies function, or environments are manipulated.

## Worldsheet
In string theory, the two-dimensional surface swept out by a string as it propagates and vibrates through spacetime. A slice of the worldsheet at a given time represents the string's complete configuration (shape and position) at that moment, while the overall geometry of the worldsheet encodes the string's entire history, including its vibrational states.
