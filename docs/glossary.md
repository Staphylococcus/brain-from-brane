# Glossary

A collection of key terms and definitions used throughout this project.

## Agent
An entity (biological, computational, or conceptual) that senses, processes, and acts upon information in order to achieve goals or maintain states.

## Competitive Dynamics
Interactions among agents or information systems driven by limited resources, selection pressures, and adaptive strategies.

## Emergence
The process by which novel, higher-level properties or behaviors arise from the interactions and organization of lower-level components.

## Fundamental Information
The raw informational content underlying physical phenomena, often viewed as the lowest-level bits or qubits that constitute matter and energy.

## Information System
A network or collection of agents, processes, and structures that collect, store, transform, and disseminate information.

## Organizational Information
Patterns and structures formed by fundamental information that give rise to complexity and functional organization in systems.

## Pattern Realism
A philosophical perspective that treats matter/energy and information as complementary patterns for understanding the universe. It emphasizes that both physical and informational descriptions are valid lenses on reality.

## Semantic Information
Informational content that carries meaning or purpose for an agent, arising from organizational information and its interpretive context.

## Semantic vs. Organizational vs. Fundamental
A hierarchy of information types:
- Fundamental: raw bits/qubits
- Organizational: structured patterns
- Semantic: interpreted meaning

## Worldsheet
In string theory, the two-dimensional surface swept out by a string as it propagates and vibrates through spacetime. A slice of the worldsheet at a given time represents the string's complete configuration (shape and position) at that moment, while the overall geometry of the worldsheet encodes the string's entire history, including its vibrational states.
