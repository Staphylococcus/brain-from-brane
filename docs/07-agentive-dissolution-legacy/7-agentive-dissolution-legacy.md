Agents, as complex, self-organizing patterns within the universal "flow of reality", represent temporarily stable configurations of worldsheets. The cessation of an agent's biological life signifies the dissolution of this specific, self-maintaining pattern and its unique subjective boundary. This section explores what then becomes of the intricate informational patterns‚Äîthe "informational legacy"‚Äîthat were generated by, or constituted, this agent. While the agent's direct, first-person processing via its "inside-out lens" ceases, the informational systems they created or embodied do not necessarily vanish. Instead, they can continue to exist, exert influence, and participate in the broader informational flow, re-instantiated and reinterpreted by other agents and information systems.

The nature and potential persistence of this informational legacy‚Äîits "richness" or "complexity"‚Äîare likely correlated with the characteristics of the agent that generated it, as defined by their position on the agent complexity scale. For example, an agent with a highly developed capacity for semantic processing, novelty, and influence may generate informational patterns of greater structural complexity, utility, or resonance. These qualities, originally shaped by the agent's unique "inside-out lens," could in turn enhance their "emergent stability and recurrence" when taken up by new hosts or substrates, thus influencing their longevity and impact within the ongoing informational flow.

Several factors contribute to the varied facets of an informational legacy's persistence:

- **Correlation with Agent Complexity Criteria:**
  - **Depth of Semantic Processing & Sophistication of "Inside-Out Lens":** Legacies built upon deep, nuanced semantic understanding (e.g., profound philosophical works, comprehensive scientific theories) may achieve greater **longevity** and **transformative power**, even if their initial **breadth of influence** is limited to specialized hosts capable of engaging with their complexity. The sophistication of the originating agent's "inside-out lens" can imbue the legacy with a structure that resonates more universally or adaptably with future "inside-out lenses."
  - **Capacity for Novelty and Influence (during life):** High novelty can lead to a highly **transformative** legacy if the novel patterns are successfully propagated. However, if too far ahead of their time or lacking effective transmission mechanisms, such legacies might fade, only to be rediscovered later if conditions become more favorable. Sustained influence during an agent's life often, but not always, translates to a broader initial **breadth of influence** for the legacy.
- **Facets of Legacy Persistence:**
  - **Longevity:** The sheer duration a legacy remains active in the informational ecosystem.
  - **Breadth of Influence:** The range of hosts (individuals, cultures, domains) the legacy impacts.
  - **Transformative Power:** The degree to which the legacy alters subsequent thought, behavior, or the structure of other information systems.
  - **Fidelity of Replication:** The accuracy with which the core patterns of the legacy are transmitted. High fidelity might be crucial for scientific or technical legacies, while artistic or narrative legacies might thrive on creative reinterpretation (lower fidelity but potentially higher resonance and adaptability).
- **Nature of the Legacy Itself:**
  - **Scientific Theories:** Persistence often hinges on continued empirical validation, explanatory power, parsimony, and integration into new, broader theories. Their **transformative power** can be immense.
  - **Artworks/Cultural Narratives:** Persistence relies on aesthetic appeal, emotional resonance, cultural significance, and the capacity for reinterpretation by new generations. Their **breadth of influence** can be vast, shaping collective identity and values.
  - **Social Structures/Norms/Institutions:** These informational legacies persist based on their perceived utility, adaptability to changing societal conditions, the power structures that uphold them, and how deeply they are embedded in collective behavior and material culture. Their **longevity** can be substantial, though often subject to gradual evolution or abrupt overthrow.
  - **Technological Blueprints/Algorithms:** Persistence depends on utility, efficiency, and adaptability. Their **transformative power** on material reality can be exceptionally direct and rapid.
- **Role of Subsequent Hosts and Information Systems (Human or AI):**
  - **Human Hosts:** The persistence and evolution of a legacy are critically dependent on human cognitive processes‚Äîremembrance, reinterpretation, teaching, and debate. Cultural shifts, new knowledge, and changing values continuously reshape how legacies are understood, valued, and utilized. The "inside-out lenses" of subsequent generations act as both filters and amplifiers.
  - **AI Systems as Hosts/Processors:** The emergence of AI introduces new dynamics. AI could lead to near-perfect **fidelity of replication** for certain digital legacies. AI's capacity to process vast datasets and identify complex patterns might allow it to "rediscover" obscure legacies, find novel connections between disparate informational patterns, or amplify the **breadth of influence** of existing ones by making them more accessible or translating them across new contexts. AI might also become a co-creator in the evolution of a legacy, generating new interpretations or extensions. However, the "black box" nature of some AI processing could also lead to reinterpretations whose lineage or rationale is opaque to human understanding, and AI-driven curation could introduce new biases in which legacies persist.

Ultimately, the enduring flow of an informational legacy is a complex interplay between the intrinsic qualities of the information itself (shaped by its originating agent) and the dynamic, selective, and interpretive environment provided by future agents and information systems.
