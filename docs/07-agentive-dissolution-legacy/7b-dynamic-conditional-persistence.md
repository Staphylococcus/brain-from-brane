This informational legacy persists by maintaining its **emergent stability and recurrence** through continued instantiation, replication, and interaction within ongoing human (and potentially AI) cognitive processes, cultural memory (e.g., texts, art, oral traditions), and societal structures. Its persistence is therefore dynamic and conditional upon these active processes of remembrance, reinterpretation, and re-instantiation by other "inside-out lenses" or information processing systems. A legacy is not static; it is continuously re-evaluated and can evolve in meaning and impact as it interacts with new informational contexts and host systems.
