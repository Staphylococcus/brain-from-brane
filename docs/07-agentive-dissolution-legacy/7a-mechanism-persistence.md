This persistence is not presented as a spiritual afterlife but occurs through the **information they created, contributed to, or were an integral part of**. This includes ideas, cultural works, scientific discoveries, technological innovations, and the enduring patterns of their actions and relationships. These are all informational constructs that can, in principle, be copied, transmitted, and instantiated in new substrates.
