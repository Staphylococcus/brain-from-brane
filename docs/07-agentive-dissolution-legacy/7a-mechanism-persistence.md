title: "Mechanism of Persistence"
summary: >
  Outlines how an agent's informational creations survive across substrates after biological death, grounding legacy persistence in copy and transmission processes.
description: >
  Introduces low-altitude analysis of substrates, curation, and propagation modifiers that determine which patterns endure and how they transform.

This persistence is not presented as a spiritual afterlife but occurs through the **information they created, contributed to, or were an integral part of**. This includes ideas, cultural works, scientific discoveries, technological innovations, and the enduring patterns of their actions and relationships. These are all informational constructs that can, in principle, be copied, transmitted, and instantiated in new substrates.
