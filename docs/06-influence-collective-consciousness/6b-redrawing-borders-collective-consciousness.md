# 6.b. Redrawing Borders in Collective Consciousness

The global flow of information, characteristic of the Information Age, can lead to a **"redrawing" of boundaries not only at the traditional national, cultural, or ideological levels but also at more subjective and conceptual levels, including the perceived demarcations of individual identity, the distinctions between conceptual categories, and the contours of social affiliations within the collective consciousness.** Observable indicators and consequences of this might include:

*   The rise of transnational identities and communities (e.g., global online forums, fandoms, professional networks that transcend national borders).
*   The impact of globalized cultural products (music, film, media) on local norms and values.
*   Increased polarization or, conversely, new solidarities based on shared information consumption patterns rather than geographical proximity.
*   Evolving challenges to notions of national sovereignty related to information control, data privacy, and cyber warfare.
