# ‚öôÔ∏è 6.a. Mechanisms of Influence on Reality
*Low Altitude Analysis*

üìç **Altitude**: Low (0-1,000 feet) - Detailed Analysis
Information systems exert influence on physical reality through two primary mechanisms:

### 6.a.1. Traditional (Agent-Mediated):

Historically, information systems primarily shape physical reality by restructuring the cognitive states (beliefs, values, motivations, models of the world) of human agents. These altered internal states then lead to new patterns of individual and collective behavior, which in turn result in tangible material and social changes. For example, a new political ideology (an information system) can lead to widespread social movements (collective behavior) that result in new laws and institutions (material and social changes).

### 6.a.2. Emerging (Direct AI-Mediated)

A significant new development is the rise of **AI systems** with agentic capabilities. These systems, as complex instantiations of information, can **directly manipulate matter and interact with the physical world** (e.g., automated manufacturing, robotics guided by computer vision LLMs) without the same degree of continuous human cognitive mediation. This represents a new, more direct pathway for information systems to exert causal influence, moving beyond solely influencing human minds to directly shaping the material environment. The development of autonomous drones or AI-controlled infrastructure are examples of this direct material agency.
