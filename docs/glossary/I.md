## Ideologies

Higher order information systems. Systematic sets of beliefs, values, and ideas that provide comprehensive frameworks for understanding and organizing social, political, and economic reality.

## Information

Within the Brain from Brane framework, information refers to meaningful patterns that exhibit:

1. **Organizational structure** that creates **constraint relationships** among the [worldsheets](W.md#worldsheet)
2. **Causal efficacy** through both semantic interpretation and **direct structural influence**
3. **Persistence mechanisms** that maintain pattern integrity across time and substrate transitions
4. **Evolutionary dynamics** that enable adaptation and competition through **structural optimization**

Information encompasses both traditional semantic content and **organizational templates** that structure reality through **structural constraint propagation**.

## Information System

Complex organizational patterns that achieve causal influence through structural organization and evolutionary dynamics, operating across biological, social, and technological substrates.

## Information Warfare

Competitive dynamics between information systems involving attempts to disrupt, manipulate, or control the transmission and processing of information within target systems or environments.

## Inside-Out Lens

The evolved first-person perspective that enables agents to organize sensory data, construct world-models, and navigate complex environments from their own centered viewpoint, representing a fundamental architecture for information processing and self-awareness.
