## Repeater/Jitter/Anchor (R/J/A) Model

A framework for analyzing information system material organization through three components:

- **Repeaters**: Active transmission and amplification mechanisms with **pattern preservation** capabilities
- **Jitter**: Variation sources that enable **controlled structural defect introduction** for adaptive evolution
- **Anchors**: Stability mechanisms that maintain **structural integrity** while allowing adaptive modification

## Resource Scarcity

Conditions where essential resources (energy, materials, information, or substrate access) are limited relative to competitive demand, driving competitive dynamics and selective pressures.

## Resonance Index (RI)

An aggregate metric quantifying the degree to which a self-stabilizing information pattern is coherently instantiated across multiple distinct substrate classes (e.g., neural, social, technological). Higher RI values signal greater resilience and evolutionary fitness via cross-substrate reinforcement.
