### Repeater/Jitter/Anchor (R/J/A) Model
A framework for analyzing information system material organization through three components:
- **Repeaters**: Active transmission and amplification mechanisms with **pattern preservation** capabilities
- **Jitter**: Variation sources that enable **controlled structural defect introduction** for adaptive evolution
- **Anchors**: Stability mechanisms that maintain **structural integrity** while allowing adaptive modification

### Resource Scarcity
Conditions where essential resources (energy, materials, information, or substrate access) are limited relative to competitive demand, driving competitive dynamics and selective pressures.
