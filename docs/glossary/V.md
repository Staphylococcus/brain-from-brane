### Value (of an Information System)
The overall perceived or actualized benefit that an Information System (IS) provides to its host (typically an [Agent](#agent) or a collective of agents). This benefit is assessed through the host's "[Inside-Out Lens](#inside-out-lens)" and can encompass a wide range of contributions, such as enhancing the host's understanding, facilitating goal achievement, improving persistence, increasing its perceived [Coherence](#coherence-of-an-information-system) (internal consistency and logical integrity of the IS itself), or fulfilling social or psychological needs. Value is often multifaceted and can be subjective. (See also: [Utility](#utility-of-an-information-system))
