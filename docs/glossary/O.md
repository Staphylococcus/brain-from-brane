## Organizational Agency

The capacity for systems to guide behavior and organize material substrates through structural influence, efficiency advantages, and energetic favorability rather than through meaning-making or intentional persuasion. Any system exhibiting non-entropic organization of matter/energy/information possesses measurable organizational agency, which operates through stabilization mechanisms and template effects. Organizational agency is distinguished from [semantic agency](S.md#semantic-agency), which requires the specific developmental sequence of thermodynamic coupling → autocatalytic networks → autopoietic organization → proto-semantic processing.

## Organizational Information

Intermediate-level information patterns that structure the arrangement and interaction of material components, representing stabilized organizational templates that coordinate complex system behavior.

## Outward Stabilization Propensity

**A fundamental principle where self-stabilizing patterns extend their organizational influence to their surrounding environment.** This process operates through **structural constraint propagation**, where a pattern imposes its inherent structure onto a receptive substrate. It is not merely passive resistance but an active extension of order that functions through mechanisms like boundary stabilization, [template effects](P.md#template-effects), and structural recruitment. This propensity drives both information system expansion and agent-environment coupling.
