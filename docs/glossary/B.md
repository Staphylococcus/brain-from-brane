## Behavioral Feedback Loops

Dynamic interaction patterns where host actions provide data that enables information systems to modify their structural compatibility and optimize their influence. Behavioral feedback loops exemplify how [algorithmic organizational templates](A.md#algorithmic-organizational-templates) create personalized environments by using host behavior to refine content delivery, interface design, and interaction patterns. These loops operate primarily through [organizational agency](O.md#organizational-agency) rather than semantic processing, creating emergent information landscapes that influence collective behavior patterns.

## Bio-Informational Complex (BIC)

A stable relationship between biological agents and structurally-stabilized information systems characterized by mutual benefit, identity integration, and co-evolutionary development. BICs develop through a five-phase sequence: Exposure → Adoption → Lock-In → Propagation → Drift/Breakdown, representing a new category of agency emerging from human-information system coupling.
