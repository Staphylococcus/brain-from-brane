## Worldsheet

A two-dimensional surface swept out by a one-dimensional string as it travels through spacetime. The collective tapestry of all worldsheets constitutes the fundamental fabric of reality, a structured process where matter/energy and information are complementary descriptions of the same underlying patterns.

The worldsheet framework justifies treating information stabilization as a literal organizational process rather than a metaphorical description, providing the ontological foundation for **measurable structural properties** of information systems.
