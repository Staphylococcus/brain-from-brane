### Utility (of an Information System)
A specific dimension of [Value](#value-of-an-information-system), representing the practical effectiveness and efficiency with which an Information System (IS) enables a host to perform a particular task, solve a specific problem, or achieve a defined objective. It measures the functional "usefulness" of the IS in a given context. An IS with high utility directly contributes to the host's operational capabilities.
