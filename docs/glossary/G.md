## Structural Information Dynamics

**The foundational framework establishing that information systems possess actual measurable organizational structures, with definite parameters, coherence properties, and stabilization dynamics that determine their influence on material substrates.**

This theory provides quantitative tools for analyzing information pattern behavior through structural analysis, compatibility assessment, and organizational optimization, enabling empirical testing of information system properties and predictive modeling of their material influence.

## Generativity (of an Information System)

The capacity of an information system to continuously generate new insights, applications, or variants that extend its [Utility](U.md#utility-of-an-information-system) and relevance. Generativity leverages beneficial forms of **[Jitter](R.md#repeaterjitteranchor-rja-model)**—variation and experimentation—while successful innovations are re-absorbed as updated **Anchors** within the system's core schema. High generativity helps a pattern remain adaptive and attractive to hosts, thereby reinforcing its long-term stability and propagation.
