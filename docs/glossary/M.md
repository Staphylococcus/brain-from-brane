## Meta-Ethical Frameworks

Higher-order organizational systems that structure and evaluate different ethical systems, providing principles for comparing and choosing between competing moral frameworks.

## Moral Pluralism

The position that multiple, potentially conflicting moral frameworks can be simultaneously valid within different contexts or from different perspectives.

## Moral Realism

The philosophical position that moral facts exist independently of what anyone believes about them, providing objective foundations for ethical evaluation.

## Moral Relativism

The position that moral judgments are relative to specific cultural, historical, or individual contexts rather than being universally valid.

## Maladaptive Rigidity

A consequence of deep [Cognitive Entrenchment](C.md#cognitive-entrenchment) where an information system's ingrained nature becomes a barrier to adopting necessary changes or new, more effective systems, especially when the environment changes significantly. This transforms resilience into a resistance to beneficial evolution.
