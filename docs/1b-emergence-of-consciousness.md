# **1.b. Emergence of Consciousness**

[Consciousness](glossary.md#consciousness), particularly [self-awareness](glossary.md#self-awareness) with its subjective qualities, is understood as a complex [**emergent property**](glossary.md#emergent-property). It emerges from highly specific, complex patterns within this dynamic spacetime tapestry (i.e., advanced biological brains—a structure whose emergence from the fundamental 'brane'-like fabric of reality might playfully be termed “brain from brane”—as intricate sub-patterns of these fundamental traces). The "[inside-out lens](glossary.md#inside-out-lens)" is how such a complex pattern of traces achieves self-awareness and structures *further* information for its own persistence.
