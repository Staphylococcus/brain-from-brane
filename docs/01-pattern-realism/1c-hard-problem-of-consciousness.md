# **1.c. Addressing the "Hard Problem" of Consciousness**

The framework approaches the challenge of subjective experience ([qualia](../glossary.md#qualia)) by first questioning the potential [**anthropocentrism**](../glossary.md#anthropocentrism) in how "qualia" are often defined and privileged, suggesting this framing might sometimes obscure understanding.

It then proposes an **evolutionary and functional explanation:** subjective states (e.g., the feeling of pain, the perception of color) are evolved, stabilizing features of certain organisms. They are integral to an [**"inside-out lens"**](../glossary.md#inside-out-lens) – a first-person perspective – which structures information in a way that is highly adaptive for self-preservation, navigation, and the overall continuity of that "[self-aware](../glossary.md#self-awareness) pocket" of the universe.

However, the framework acknowledges that while this explains the *function* and *adaptive advantage* of such subjective states, the precise ontological nature of *how* non-experiential material organization gives rise to irreducible, first-person phenomenal experience remains a profound area of ongoing inquiry and a central challenge for any comprehensive materialist account.
