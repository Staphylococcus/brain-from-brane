How do mind-independent physical patterns turn into mind-dependent meaning? The journey is **continuous in substrate**—a backdrop of reality that changes more slowly than the patterns it carries—and yet **discontinuous in capability**. At six identifiable thresholds new feedback loops appear, locking-in qualitatively different kinds of information. Once crossed, these thresholds are never re-crossed in reverse; snowflakes do not become quarks again, and languages do not forget how to mean.

Below is a bird's-eye story of those thresholds. If you'd rather dive into equations and diagrams, follow the links; if you just want to "feel" the shape of the ascent, stay on this page.

## Stage I – Stable Structures & the Particle Alphabet

Nature’s first miracle is **reliability**. Quantum jitters are tamed by code-like symmetries so that an electron here is an electron everywhere. These stable vibrational modes form a “cosmic alphabet.” Because the alphabet is *biased*—some letters are far more probable than others—the universe starts off with structure already baked in. That statistical bias is what later agents will exploit as “physical laws.”

## Stage II – Environmental Information: Patterns as Potential Cues

When stable particles aggregate, they cast shadows, echoes, gradients—**regularities in spacetime**. A red patch on a leaf says nothing by itself; yet it *could* be read as nectar, disease, or camouflage. The environment thus offers a library of *latent* information whose pages will remain blank until readers evolve.

## Stage II.5 – Thermodynamic Bridge: From Matter to Autopoiesis

Energy gradients do the heavy lifting. Far-from-equilibrium chemistry first spins up dissipative whirlpools, then autocatalytic networks, and finally **autopoietic cells** that redraw the universe into *inside* and *outside*. With that boundary comes the first evaluative stance: patterns are now sorted by "helps me persist / hurts me / irrelevant."

## Stage III – Proto-Semantics: Detection, Valence, Action

Sensors, receptors, ion channels—tiny yes/no widgets—map specific external patterns onto specific metabolic responses. Meaning here is **actionable valence**. Sugar gradients *mean* food; pH shifts *mean* danger. There is no detached representation—only functional coupling between cue and consequence.

## Stage IV – Developing Semantics: Internal Models & Prediction

Nervous systems decouple perception from action long enough to **simulate**. Neural codes stand in for distal states; forward models forecast futures; plasticity writes experience back into structure. Meaning stretches across time ("If dark clouds, then rain later") and becomes context-sensitive ("Clouds mean relief for a drought-stressed plant but danger for a picnic").

## Stage V – Full-Blown Semantics: Symbolic, Shared Worlds

With language the game changes again: tokens need not resemble their referents; grammar lets finite symbols yield infinite thoughts; and culture stores cognition off-brain. Meaning is now collectively *negotiated* and *transmitted* across generations. Whole civilizations ride atop these high-altitude information systems.

## Stage VI – Principles, Constraints & Tests

Looking back we can state the invariants: physical grounding at every tier, staircase-style emergence, and the ever-tightening feedback loop of the inside-out lens.

**Want the hard science and rival theories?** These principles generate predictions—outlined in the Tests file—that invite the model to be proven wrong. See the falsification matrix and comparative analysis.
