üìç **Altitude**: Low (0-1,000 feet) - Detailed Analysis

The pathway is only useful if it risks being wrong. Below are concrete criteria that could **falsify** the model, followed by a side-by-side comparison with alternative accounts of consciousness and meaning.

## Falsification Criteria for Pathway Emergence

Falsification criteria table

| Criterion | Framework Prediction | Falsification Conditions |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Stage Progression** | Development must follow the sequence: organizational patterns ‚Üí environmental cues ‚Üí thermodynamic coupling ‚Üí proto-semantics ‚Üí neural representation ‚Üí symbolic systems | Discovery of symbolic agents with no neural representation, or of proto-semantic agents that never experienced thermodynamic coupling |
| **Thermodynamic Bridge** | Far-from-equilibrium energy flow is required for the inside-out lens | Semantic information emerging in closed, equilibrium systems |
| **Autocatalytic Development** | Once proto-semantics appears, semantic complexity accelerates via positive feedback | Strictly linear growth despite abundant selection pressure |
| **Autopoietic Integration** | Advanced semantics requires autopoiesis & boundary maintenance | Coherent high-level semantics in completely passive, non-autopoietic systems |
| **Symbolic Threshold** | The shift to symbolism yields a combinatorial explosion of possible meanings | Absence of threshold effects when agents acquire symbolic tokens |

## Comparative Framework Analysis

Comparative framework analysis table

| Theory | Traditional Position | This Framework's Distinction | Empirical Differentiator |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Information Integration Theory (IIT)** | Consciousness = integrated information (Œ¶) regardless of origin | Adds evolutionary & thermodynamic context; integration *alone* not enough | Requires developmental history + energy flow |
| **Predictive Processing** | Mind = hierarchical prediction error minimization | Prediction is necessary but insufficient; must be nested in autopoiesis | Thermodynamic / autopoietic thresholds |
| **Enactive Cognition** | Meaning arises from embodied interaction | Supplies specific phase transitions (autocatalytic, autopoietic) & testable energy thresholds | Observable connectivity & energy-flow markers |
| **Computational Theory of Mind** | Mental states are syntactic symbol manipulations | Rejects syntax-only emergence; demands functional grounding via evolution and energy | Semantic agents without energy coupling would falsify computational sufficiency |
| **Panpsychist Information Theories** | Consciousness is fundamental at all scales | Claims semantic information is *not* ubiquitous; emerges only after specific thresholds | Absence of semantics in sub-threshold systems |
