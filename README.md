# Brain from Brane: An Ontology of Information and Fluid Reality

Welcome to the "Brain from Brane" project, which presents a comprehensive ontology that conceptualizes the universe as a dynamic, higher-dimensional informational continuum. This framework explores the intricate relationships between information, matter, and consciousness, providing insights into the nature of reality and the role of agents as information processors.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several Markdown files, each focusing on specific aspects of the ontology:

- **docs/0-introduction.md**: Introduction to the ontology, outlining fundamental concepts and the framework's purpose.
- **docs/1-pattern-realism.md**: Discussion of pattern realism, presenting matter/energy and information as complementary lenses for understanding the universe.
- **docs/1a-nature-of-information.md**: Exploration of the nature of information, distinguishing between fundamental and organizational aspects.
- **docs/1a1-pathway-emergence.md**: Outline of the pathway of emergence from organizational to semantic information, detailing the stages of development.
- **docs/1b-emergence-of-consciousness.md**: Examination of the emergence of consciousness as a complex property arising from advanced information processing.
- **docs/1c-hard-problem-of-consciousness.md**: Addressing the hard problem of consciousness, discussing subjective experience and its evolutionary significance.
- **docs/2-oneness-interconnectedness.md**: Presentation of the universe as a single, interconnected whole, emphasizing the dynamic tapestry of worldsheets.
- **docs/2a-emergent-subjective-distinctions.md**: Discussion on how subjective distinctions arise within the structured whole of the universe.
- **docs/2b-reconciling-oneness-and-competition.md**: Exploration of the competitive dynamics that emerge within the interconnected whole, driven by resource scarcity.
- **docs/3-agents-as-information-processors.md**: Characterization of agents as information processors, detailing their capabilities and complexity.
- **docs/4-information-systems.md**: Discussion on the role of information systems in shaping agent behavior and cultural narratives.
- **docs/5-competitive-dynamics.md**: Examination of the competitive dynamics of information systems and their influence on agents and society.
