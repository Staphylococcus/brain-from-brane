# Brain from Brane: An Ontology of Information and Fluid Reality

Welcome to the "Brain from Brane" project—a comprehensive ontology that reimagines the universe as a dynamic, higher-dimensional informational continuum. This framework explores the intricate relationships between information, matter, and consciousness, providing insights into the nature of reality and the role of agents as information processors.

<!-- FRAMEWORK_GRAPH -->

## Navigating This Exploration

As you embark on this intellectual journey, you'll encounter a unique blend of established scientific insights and speculative theoretical bridges. This exploration weaves together well-grounded principles from thermodynamics, information theory, complexity science, and emergence research with philosophical extrapolations that venture beyond current empirical boundaries.

**The Nature of Our Journey:** This is not a presentation of experimentally validated theories, but rather a scientifically-informed philosophical expedition. Along the way, we'll distinguish between what current science firmly supports—such as thermodynamic principles, information-theoretic measures, and documented emergence phenomena—and where we venture into more speculative territory, such as worldsheet ontology and co-fundamental information theories.

**What to Expect:** This framework aims to integrate insights from multiple disciplines into a coherent worldview, generate novel conceptual tools for understanding consciousness and information, and provide practical frameworks for analyzing complex systems. Throughout the journey, we maintain intellectual honesty by clearly marking the difference between established knowledge and theoretical proposals, inviting you to engage with both as part of a sophisticated synthesis rather than established doctrine.

**A Framework in Motion:** This ontology is in a continuous state of becoming. Some sections are more fleshed out than others, and the ideas presented here will evolve as they are confronted with new insights, critiques, and reality itself. Consider this a living document, and engage with it as such.

## The Framework Journey: Eight Interconnected Explorations

### Introduction: Core Concepts of an Informational Universe

Our exploration begins with a fundamental reimagining: the universe as a dynamic, higher-dimensional **informational continuum** where the dance between information, matter, and consciousness shapes all of reality. This "Brain from Brane" ontology reveals how complexity and meaning emerge from evolving informational patterns, offering a coherent framework that bridges physics, consciousness studies, and information theory.

### [1 Pattern Realism](docs/01-pattern-realism/1-pattern-realism.md)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->
*Reality as Co-Fundamental Information and Matter Patterns*
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD036 -->
**Pattern Realism** establishes our foundational perspective: reality consists of dynamic patterns best understood through two co-fundamental lenses—matter/energy and information. Information unfolds in layers from **Fundamental Information** (basic properties of foundational entities like **Worldsheets**) through **Organizational Information** (structural complexities) to **Semantic Information** (meaningful content interpreted by agents through their "inside-out lens"). This layered emergence enables consciousness to arise when the inside-out lens becomes **recursive**—examining itself through autopoietic self-reference, creating the sophisticated informational property where agents develop self-awareness through their unique lens-mediated environmental interactions.

### [2 Oneness and Interconnectedness](docs/02-oneness-interconnectedness/2-oneness-interconnectedness.md)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->
*Unity and Distinction in an Interconnected Reality*
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD036 -->

The **Worldsheet** tapestry weaves a universe that is simultaneously one interconnected whole and inherently structured reality. This apparent paradox resolves through understanding how individual perspectives emerge as agent-relative interpretations of pre-existing universal structure, while competitive dynamics arise naturally within the interconnected system due to resource scarcity and evolutionary pressures. A unified functional framework explains how different **boundary mechanisms**—from biochemical membranes to statistical and social constructs—all serve the same core purpose: stabilizing information patterns.

### [3 Agents as Information Processors](docs/03-agents-as-information-processors/3-agents-as-information-processors.md)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->
*Self-Aware Pockets of the Universe*
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD036 -->

**Agents** emerge as self-organizing entities—from simple biological forms to complex conscious beings and evolving AI—that sense, process, and are constituted by information. Each develops a unique "inside-out lens" shaped by evolutionary history and informational needs, enabling meaning generation and action guidance. Agents exist on a complexity spectrum measured through semantic processing depth, self-awareness sophistication, autonomy, and environmental organization capacity.

### [4 Information Systems](docs/04-information-systems/4-information-systems.md)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->
*Dynamic Frameworks with Agent-Like Properties*
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD036 -->

Beyond individual processing, agents collectively create and are shaped by **Information Systems**—dynamic, evolving frameworks including languages, ideologies, cultural narratives, and technologies that exhibit agent-like properties of propagation, evolution, and competition. These systems engage in profound co-evolutionary relationships with biological agents, functioning like "mitochondria" that provide organizational energy while agents provide cognitive substrate. This symbiotic evolution traces from embodied knowledge through linguistic revolution to autonomous AI emergence.

### [5 Competitive Dynamics](docs/05-competitive-dynamics/5-competitive-dynamics.md)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->
*Multi-Level Competition Across Information Landscapes*
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD036 -->

**Competitive Dynamics** operate not only between agents but within and among information systems across multiple levels—from individual cognition to collective consciousness. Systems compete for attention, adoption, influence, and physical substrates through mechanisms including confrontation, co-option, niche differentiation, and adaptive resilience. A key development is **Bio-Informational Complexes (BIC)**—integrated units where biological hosts and information systems function as quasi-organismic wholes, driving innovation while perpetually molding the dance between agents, information, and society.

### [6 Mechanisms of Influence and Collective Consciousness](docs/06-influence-collective-consciousness/6-influence-collective-consciousness.md)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->
*Reshaping Reality Through Information Flow*
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD036 -->

Information systems actively reshape both physical reality and collective human experience through two pathways: traditional influence via human agents whose altered cognitive states drive material changes, and emerging AI-mediated direct actions on the physical world. The unprecedented global information flow dynamically redraws conceptual, cultural, and identity boundaries, creating new hybrid informational spaces that fundamentally reshape individual and collective awareness.

### [7 Agentive Dissolution and Informational Legacy](docs/07-agentive-dissolution-legacy/7-agentive-dissolution-legacy.md)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->
*Persistence Beyond Individual Agents*
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD036 -->

As temporary self-organizing patterns, agents dissolve, but their **informational legacies**—ideas, creations, action patterns—persist through continued instantiation, replication, and reinterpretation by other agents and information systems. This persistence represents not spiritual afterlife but dynamic conditional processes shaped by legacy richness, transformative power, and fidelity of replication, correlated with the originating agent's complexity, novelty, and influence.

### [8 Fluid Reality](docs/08-fluid-reality/8-fluid-reality.md)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->
*The Universe as Dynamic Flow and Emergent Stability*
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD036 -->

**Fluid Reality** presents our culminating vision: reality as inherently dynamic flow rather than static entities—a continuous "Panta Rhei" process of becoming and transformation. All observable structures, from fundamental particles to consciousness itself, emerge as exceptionally stable, self-reinforcing patterns that form consistent backgrounds against which more transient phenomena unfold, emphasizing the universe's continuous creative evolution while maintaining apparent solidity.
