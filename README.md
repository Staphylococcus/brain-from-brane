# Brain from Brane: An Ontology of Information and Fluid Reality

Welcome to the "Brain from Brane" project, which presents a comprehensive ontology that conceptualizes the universe as a dynamic, higher-dimensional informational continuum. This framework explores the intricate relationships between information, matter, and consciousness, providing insights into the nature of reality and the role of agents as information processors.

## Project Structure

The "Brain from Brane" ontology unfolds progressively, starting with core definitions and building towards a comprehensive model of information, reality, and consciousness. This structured overview allows you to grasp the main arguments at a high level, with direct links to explore each concept in depth.

### Introduction: Core Concepts of an Informational Universe

Our journey begins with a fundamental re-imagining of the universe: not merely as a stage for physical events, but as a dynamic, higher-dimensional **informational continuum**. This "Brain from Brane" ontology posits that the intricate dance between information, matter, and consciousness is key to understanding reality. We explore how complexity and meaning emerge from an evolving tapestry of informational patterns, aiming for a coherent, broadly 'informational physicalist' account of existence.

### [1 Pattern Realism](docs/1-pattern-realism.md)

From this initial vision, we embrace **Pattern Realism**, a perspective where information and matter/energy are not primary and secondary, but complementary and equally fundamental patterns that describe our universe. Reality, then, is understood through these interacting patterns. The [Nature of Information (1a)](docs/1a-nature-of-information.md) itself unfolds in layers: from raw, **Fundamental Information** (the basic states of reality), to **Organizational Information** (structures and complexities), and culminating in **Semantic Information**—meaningful content interpreted by an agent. This transformation isn't accidental; [Pathway Emergence (1a1)](docs/1a1-pathway-emergence.md) describes how stable routes for information flow are carved out, allowing simpler patterns to coalesce into the rich, interpretable information that agents use. This understanding of information processing paves the way for tackling one of philosophy's greatest challenges. The [Emergence of Consciousness (1b)](docs/1b-emergence-of-consciousness.md) is thus framed as a highly sophisticated, emergent property arising from this advanced informational activity within complex systems. Consequently, the [Hard Problem of Consciousness (1c)](docs/1c-hard-problem-of-consciousness.md)—the puzzle of subjective experience, or **Qualia**—is approached not as an inexplicable anomaly, but as an evolved feature of this informational landscape, deeply intertwined with an agent's interaction with its environment.

### [2 Oneness and Interconnectedness](docs/2-oneness-interconnectedness.md)

The ontology then expands our view to perceive the universe as a single, profoundly interconnected whole—a vast, dynamic tapestry, perhaps best visualized through the concept of **Worldsheets** that trace the history and interactions of all patterns. Yet, within this fundamental unity, how do we experience ourselves and the world as composed of distinct entities? [Emergent Subjective Distinctions (2a)](docs/2a-emergent-subjective-distinctions.md) explains how individual perspectives, the sense of "self," and the perception of separate agents and objects arise as emergent features from within this structured, interconnected whole. This leads to an apparent paradox: if all is one, why is there struggle and competition? [Reconciling Oneness and Competition (2b)](docs/2b-reconciling-oneness-and-competition.md) addresses this by showing how competitive dynamics, often fueled by **Resource Scarcity** (whether of energy, matter, or even informational bandwidth), naturally emerge and drive evolution even within a system that is, at its deepest level, entirely interconnected.

### [3 Agents as Information Processors](docs/3-agents-as-information-processors.md)

Within this dynamic and interconnected reality, **Agents** emerge as pivotal players, characterized primarily by their capacity to sense, process, and act upon information. [Agents as Information Processors (3)](docs/3-agents-as-information-processors.md) explores how these entities, ranging from simple biological organisms to complex conscious beings and potentially even sophisticated artificial systems, navigate their environments. Their capabilities and complexity vary immensely, but all are defined by their interaction with the informational landscape. They develop internal models of their world—an "inside-out lens"—that are inherently **Agent-relative**, shaped by their unique needs, evolutionary history, and the specific patterns of information relevant to their survival and goals. This agent-centric view is crucial for understanding how meaning is generated and how action is guided in a universe rich with information.

### [4 Information Systems](docs/4-information-systems.md)

As agents interact and evolve, they don't just process information individually; they collectively create and are shaped by **Information Systems**. [Information Systems (4)](docs/4-information-systems.md) delves into these larger, often abstract, yet profoundly influential structures. These are not merely collections of data, but dynamic, evolving frameworks that include **Cognitive Frameworks**, shared **Cultural Narratives**, **Ideologies**, **Social Norms**, languages, scientific theories, and even complex **Technological Advancements**. These systems emerge from the collective informational activities of agents and, in turn, exert a powerful influence on agent perception, behavior, and societal development. They form a kind of informational ecosystem, complete with **Feedback Loops**, where ideas and practices are generated, transmitted, and refined, often through processes akin to **Cultural Evolution**. Understanding these systems is key to grasping how collective intelligence and large-scale societal patterns emerge and persist.

### [5 Competitive Dynamics](docs/5-competitive-dynamics.md)

Finally, the ontology examines the **Competitive Dynamics** that are inherent not only between agents but also within and between these vast Information Systems themselves. [Competitive Dynamics (5)](docs/5-competitive-dynamics.md) explores how these systems, much like biological organisms, vie for resources—attention, adoption, influence, and the physical substrates required for their maintenance and propagation. This competition drives the evolution of ideas, technologies, and social structures. It explains how certain narratives become dominant, how ideologies clash and transform, and how technological advancements can disrupt and reconfigure the informational landscape. These dynamics are not necessarily destructive; they are also the engine of innovation and adaptation, constantly shaping the complex interplay between agents, the information they process, and the societies they build. This concluding perspective brings the ontology full circle, showing a universe that is not static but constantly co-evolving through the interplay of information, agency, and systemic competition.

### [6 Mechanisms of Influence and Redrawing Borders in Collective Consciousness](docs/6-influence-collective-consciousness.md)

The influence of these information systems isn't confined to abstract realms; they actively shape physical reality and collective human experience. [Mechanisms of Influence and Redrawing Borders in Collective Consciousness (6)](docs/6-influence-collective-consciousness.md) explores two key pathways: traditionally, through human agents whose altered cognitive states lead to material changes, and increasingly, via direct AI-mediated actions on the physical world. Furthermore, the unprecedented global flow of information in our current age is dynamically redrawing conceptual and cultural boundaries. This section examines how external informational "currents" interact with existing internal landscapes, leading to the erosion of old borders, the formation of new hybrid informational spaces, and a fundamental reshaping of individual and collective identity and awareness.

### [7 Agentive Dissolution and the Enduring Flow of Informational Legacies](docs/7-agentive-dissolution-legacy.md)

Given that agents are temporary, self-organizing patterns, what becomes of their informational contributions upon their dissolution? [Agentive Dissolution and the Enduring Flow of Informational Legacies (7)](docs/7-agentive-dissolution-legacy.md) addresses this by proposing that an agent's "informational legacy"—their ideas, creations, and the patterns of their actions—can persist and continue to influence the world. This persistence isn't a spiritual afterlife but occurs through the continued instantiation, replication, and reinterpretation of these informational constructs by other agents (human or AI) and information systems. The richness, longevity, and transformative power of such a legacy are often correlated with the complexity and novelty of the originating agent, and its endurance is a dynamic, conditional process shaped by future informational contexts and host systems.

### [8 Fluid Reality](docs/8-fluid-reality.md)

Culminating this exploration, the ontology presents a vision of **Fluid Reality**. [Fluid Reality (8)](docs/8-fluid-reality.md) posits that, at its most fundamental, reality is not a collection of static entities but a dynamic, inherently structured flow—a continuous process of becoming and transformation ("Panta Rhei"). Within this flux, all observable structures, from fundamental particles to complex information systems, and even the seemingly steadfast laws of physics, are understood as emergent properties. They represent exceptionally stable, self-reinforcing, and widely instantiated patterns that form a consistent background against which more transient phenomena play out, emphasizing the universe's continuous, creative unfolding.
