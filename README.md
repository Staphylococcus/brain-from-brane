# Brain from Brane: An Ontology of Information and Fluid Reality

Welcome to the "Brain from Brane" project, which presents a comprehensive ontology that conceptualizes the universe as a dynamic, higher-dimensional informational continuum. This framework explores the intricate relationships between information, matter, and consciousness, providing insights into the nature of reality and the role of agents as information processors.

## Project Structure

- [0 Introduction](docs/0-introduction.md): Introduction to the ontology, outlining fundamental concepts and the framework's purpose.
- [Glossary](docs/glossary.md): Key terms and definitions used throughout the project.
- [1 Pattern Realism](docs/1-pattern-realism.md): Discussion of pattern realism, presenting matter/energy and information as complementary lenses for understanding the universe.
- [1a Nature of Information](docs/1a-nature-of-information.md): Exploration of the nature of information, distinguishing between fundamental and organizational aspects.
- [1a1 Pathway of Emergence](docs/1a1-pathway-emergence.md): Outline of the pathway of emergence from organizational to semantic information, detailing the stages of development.
- [1b Emergence of Consciousness](docs/1b-emergence-of-consciousness.md): Examination of the emergence of consciousness as a complex property arising from advanced information processing.
- [1c Hard Problem of Consciousness](docs/1c-hard-problem-of-consciousness.md): Addressing the hard problem of consciousness, discussing subjective experience and its evolutionary significance.
- [2 Oneness and Interconnectedness](docs/2-oneness-interconnectedness.md): Presentation of the universe as a single, interconnected whole, emphasizing the dynamic tapestry of worldsheets.
- [2a Emergent Subjective Distinctions](docs/2a-emergent-subjective-distinctions.md): Discussion on how subjective distinctions arise within the structured whole of the universe.
- [2b Reconciling Oneness and Competition](docs/2b-reconciling-oneness-and-competition.md): Exploration of the competitive dynamics that emerge within the interconnected whole, driven by resource scarcity.
- [3 Agents as Information Processors](docs/3-agents-as-information-processors.md): Characterization of agents as information processors, detailing their capabilities and complexity.
- [4 Information Systems](docs/4-information-systems.md): Discussion on the role of information systems in shaping agent behavior and cultural narratives.
- [5 Competitive Dynamics](docs/5-competitive-dynamics.md): Examination of the competitive dynamics of information systems and their influence on agents and society.
